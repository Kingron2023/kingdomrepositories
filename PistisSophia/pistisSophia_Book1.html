<P>CHAPTER 1</STRONG> </P>
<P>But it happened that after Jesus had risen from the dead he spent eleven 
years speaking with his disciples . And he taught them only as far as the places 
of the first ordinance and as far as the places of the First Mystery, which is 
within the veil which is within the first ordinance, which is the 24th mystery 
outside and below , these which are in the second space of the First Mystery, 
which is before all mysteries the Father in the form of a dove . And Jesus said 
to his disciples : "I have come forth from that First Mystery which is the last 
mystery, namely the 24th".. </P>
<P>And the disciples did not know and understand that there was anything within 
that mystery. But they thought that that mystery was the head of the All , and 
the head of all the things that exist . And they thought that it was the 
completion of all completions, because Jesus had said to them concerning the 
mystery, that it surrounded the first ordinance and the five incisions and the 
great light and the five helpers (parastatai) and the whole Treasury of Light. 
And moreover Jesus had not spoken to his disciples of the whole extent of the 
places of the great invisible one and the three triple powers and the 24 
invisible ones and all their places and their aeons and all their ranks, how 
they extend - these which are the emanations of the great invisible one - and 
their unbegotten ones and their self-begotten ones and their begotten ones and 
their luminaries and their unpaired ones and their archons and their powers 
(exousiai) and their lords and their archangels and their angels and their 
decans and their ministers and all the houses of their spheres and all the ranks 
of each one of them. </P>
<P>And Jesus had not told his disciples of the whole extent of the emanations of 
the treasury, nor their ranks how they extend, nor had he told them of their 
saviours, according to the rank of each one, how they are. Nor had he told them 
which watcher is over each of the doors of the Treasury of Light. Nor had he 
told them of the place of the twin saviour who is the child of the child. Nor 
had he told them of the place of the three amens, in which places they extend, 
and he had not told them in which places the five trees are spread, nor of the 
seven other amens, namely the seven voices, which their place is and how they 
extend. And Jesus had not told his disciples of what type are the five helpers 
(Parastatai). Or into which places they are brought. Nor had he told them in 
what manner the great light extends, or into which places it is brought- Nor had 
he told them of the five incisions, nor concerning the first ordinance, into 
which places they are brought. But he had only spoken to them in general, 
teaching them that they existed. But he had not told them their extent and the 
rank of their places according to how they exist. Because of this they also did 
not know that other places existed within that mystery. And he had not said to 
his disciples : "I came forth from such and such places until I entered that 
mystery, until I came forth from it." But he had said to them as hen thaught 
them : "I came forth from that mystery". </P>
<P>Because of this they thought now of that mystery that it was the completion 
of all completions, and that it was the head of the All, and that it was (the) 
whole pleroma, since Jesus had said to his disciples : "That mystery surrounds 
the totalities of which I have told you all from the day on which I met you 
until today". Because of this the disciples thought now that there was nothing 
existing within that mystery..</P>
<HR>

<P><STRONG>CHAPTER 2.</STRONG> </P>
<P>It happened as the disciples were sitting with one another upon the Mount of 
Olives, as they spoke these words they rejoiced with great joy, and they were 
very jubilant, and they said to one another: "We are blessed beyond all men who 
are on earth because the Saviour has revealed these things to us, and we have 
received the pleroma and the whole completion". As they were saying these things 
to one another, Jesus was sitting at a short distance from them. </P>
<P>It happened, however, on the 1st of the moon in the month of Tôbe, which is 
the day on which the moon becomes full, now on that day when the sun had risen 
on its path , there came forth after it a great power of light, giving a very 
great light, and there was no measure to its accompanying light , for it came 
forth from the Light of Lights, exceedingly, with (a) light to which there was 
no measure. </P>
<P>And the disciples gazed after him, and not one of them spoke until he had 
reached heaven, but they all kept a great silence. Now these things happened on 
the 15th of the moon, on the day on which it is full in the month of Tôbe. </P>
<P>Now it happened when Jesus went up to heaven, after three hours all the 
powers of the heavens were disturbed, and they all shook against one another, 
they and all their aeons, and all their places and all their ranks and the whole 
earth moved with all who dwelt upon it. And all the men in the world were 
agitated, and also the disciples. And they all thought : "Perhaps the world will 
be rolled up". And all the powers which are in the heavens did not cease from 
their agitation, they and the whole world, and they all moved against one 
another from the third hour of the 15th of the moon in (the month of) Tôbe until 
the ninth hour of the following day. And all the angels and their archangels and 
all the powers of the height all sang praises to the innermost of the inner , so 
that the whole world heard their voices, and they did not cease until the ninth 
hour of the following day. </P>
<P><STRONG>CHAPTER 3.</STRONG> </P>
<P>Now it happened when the light-power had come down upon Jesus, it gradually 
surrounded him completely. </P>
<P>Then Jesus rose or ascended to the height, giving light exceedingly, with (a) 
light to which there was no measure. </P>
<P>And the disciples gazed after him, and not one of them spoke until he had 
reached heaven, but they all kept a great silence. Now these things happened on 
the 1st of the moon, on the day on which it is full in the month of Tôbe. </P>
<P>Now it happened when Jesus went up to heaven, after three hours all the 
powers of the heavens were disturbed, and they all shook against one another , 
they and all their aeons, and all their places and all their ranks and the whole 
earth moved with all who dwelt upon it. And all the men in the world were 
agitated, and also the disciples. And they all thought : "Perhaps the world will 
be rolled up". And all the powers which are in the heavens did not cease from 
their agitation, they and the whole world, and they all moved against one 
another from the third hour of the 1st of the moon in (the month on Tôbe until 
the ninth hour of the following day. And all the angels and their archangels and 
all the powers of the height all sang praises to the innermost of the inner , so 
that the whole world heard their voices, and they did not cease until the ninth 
hour of the following day. </P>
<HR>

<P><STRONG>CHAPTER 4</STRONG>. </P>
<P>The disciples, however, sat with one another in fear, and were greatly 
agitated. ( They were afraid, however, on account of the great earthquake which 
happened, and they wept together, saying: "What will happen now? Perhaps the 
Saviour will destroy all the places". </P>
<P>As they were saying these things and were weeping to one another, on the 
ninth hour of the following day the heavens opened, and they saw Jesus coming 
down, giving light exceedingly, and there was no measure to the light in which 
he was. For he gave more light than in the hour -that he went up to heaven, so 
that the men in the world were not able to speak of the light which was his, and 
it cast forth very many rays of light, and there was no measure to its rays. And 
his light was not equal throughout, but it was of different kinds, and it was of 
different types, so that some were many times superior to others, and the whole 
light together was in three forms, and the one was many times superior to the 
other; the second which was in the middle was superior to the first which was 
below; and the third which was above them all was superior to the second which 
was below. And the first ray which was below them all was similar to the light 
which had come down upon Jesus before he went up to heaven, and it was quite 
equal to it in its light. And the three light-forms were of different kinds of 
light and they were of different types. And some were many times superior to 
others.</P>
<HR>

<P><STRONG>CHAPTER 5.</STRONG> </P>
<P>It happened, however, when the disciples saw these they were greatly afraid 
and agitated. Now Jesus, the compassionate and tender-hearted, when he saw that 
his disciples were in great agitation, he spoke to them saying : "Be courageous. 
It is I, do not fear" .</P>
<HR>

<P><STRONG>CHAPTER 6</STRONG>. </P>
<P>Now it happened when the disciples heard these words, they said : "Lord, if 
it be thou, draw thy light-glory to thyself so that we can stand, otherwise our 
eyes are darkened and we are agitated, and also the whole world is agitated 1, 
because of the great light which is thine". </P>
<P>Then Jesus drew to himself the glory of his light. And when this had happened 
all the disciples took courage, they came before Jesus, they all prostrated 
themselves at the same time, they worshipped him, rejoicing with great joy. They 
said to him : "Rabbi, where didst thou go, or what was thy service in which thou 
didst go, or for what reason were all these disturbances and all these 
earthquakes which happened ?". </P>
<P>Then Jesus, the compassionate, said to them : "Rejoice and be glad from this 
hour because I have been to the places from whence I came forth. From today 
onwards now I will speak with you openly from the beginning of the truth until 
its completion. And I will speak with you face to face, without parable . I will 
not conceal from you, from this hour onwards, anything of the things of the 
height and of the place of the truth . For I have been given authority , through 
the Ineffable and through the First Mystery of all the mysteries, that I should 
speak with you from the beginning until the pleroma, and from within outwards, 
and from without inwards. Hear now, so that I tell you all things. </P>
<P>It happened as I was sitting at a short distance from you upon the Mount of 
Olives, I was thinking of the rank of the service for which I was sent, that it 
should be completed, and that my garment was not yet sent to me by the First 
Mystery, which is the 24th mystery from within outwards. </P>
<P>These (24 mysteries) are in the second space of the First Mystery in the rank 
of that space. It happened now when I knew that the rank of the service for 
which I had been sent was completed, and that that mystery had not yet sent me 
the garment, which I had left behind within it until the time was completed - as 
I thought of these things, I was sitting upon the Mount of Olives at a short 
distance from you.</P>
<HR>

<P><STRONG>CHAPTER 7</STRONG> </P>
<P>It happened when the sun rose in the East now after- wards, through the First 
Mystery which had existed from the beginning, because of which ( the All 
existed, from which I myself have come just now - not prior to my crucifixion , 
but now - it happened through the command of that mystery, it sent me my garment 
of light, which it had given to me from the beginning, which I had left behind 
in the last mystery which is the 24th mystery from within outwards, these (24 
mysteries) which are in the ranks of the second space of the First Mystery. That 
garment (of light) now I had left behind in the last mystery until the time was 
completed that I should put it on me, and that I should begin to speak with the 
race of mankind, and reveal to them all things from the beginning of the truth 
until its completion, and speak to them from the innermost of the inner to the 
outermost of the outer, and from the outermost of the outer to the innermost of 
the inner. Rejoice and be glad , and rejoice still more, that it is given to you 
that I should speak with you first from the beginning of the truth until its 
completion. Because of this indeed I have chosen you from the beginning ( 
through the First Mystery. Rejoice now and be glad , because when I entered the 
world I brought the twelve powers with me, as I told you from the beginning, 
which I took from the twelve saviours of the Treasury of Light, according to the 
command of the First Mystery. </P>
<P>These now I cast into the wombs of your mothers when I came into the world, 
and it is these which are in your bodies today. For these powers have been given 
to you above the whole world, for you are those who are able to save the whole 
world, so that you should be able to withstand the threat of the archons of the 
world, and the sufferings of the world and their dangers, and all their 
persecutions which the archons of the height will bring upon you. For I have 
said to you many times that the power which is within you I have brought from 
the twelve saviours, which are in the Treasury of Light. For this reason I have 
indeed said to you from the beginning that you are not from the world; I also am 
not from it . For all men who are in the world have received souls from (the 
power) of the archons of the aeons. The power, however, which is in you, is from 
me but your souls belong to the height. I have brought twelve powers of the 
twelve saviours of the Treasury of the Light, taking them from the part of my 
power which I received at first. And when I entered the world I came to the 
midst of the archons of the sphere, and I took the likeness of Gabriel, the 
Angel of the aeons, and the archers of the aeons did not recognize me . But they 
thought that I was the Angel Gabriel. Now it happened that when I came into the 
midst of the archons of the aeons, I looked down at the world of mankind, at the 
command of the First Mystery. </P>
<P>I found Elisabeth, the mother of John the Baptist , before she had conceived 
him and I cast into her a power which I had received from the Little Jao , the 
Good, who is in the Midst, so that he should be able to preach before me, and 
prepare my way and baptise with water of forgiveness . </P>
<P>Now that power was in the body of John. And again, in place of the soul of 
the archons which he was due to receive, I found the soul of the prophet Elias 
in the aeons of the sphere; and I took it in and I took his soul again; I 
brought it to the Virgin of the Light, and she gave it to her paralemptors . 
They brought it to the sphere of the archons, and they cast it into the womb of 
Elisabeth. But the power of the Little Jao, he of the Midst, and the soul of the 
prophet Elias were bound in the body of John the Baptist. </P>
<P>You doubted now at the time when I spoke to you because John said : 'I am not 
the Christ' and you said to me : 'lt is written in the scripture : when the 
Christ shall come, there will come Elias before him and he will prepare his 
way'. But when you said this to me, I said to you : 'Elias has indeed come and 
he has prepared all things, as it is written : And they did to him as they 
pleased. And when I knew that you did not understand what I said to you 
concerning the soul of Elias, which was bound in John the Baptist, I answered 
you openly in speech, face to face, saying : 'If it pleases you to accept John 
the Baptist, he is Elias of whom I have said that he will come'".</P>
<HR>

<P><STRONG>CHAPTER 8.</STRONG> </P>
<P>Jesus continued again speaking and said: "Now it happened after this, through 
the command of the First Mystery, I looked down again upon the world of mankind, 
I found Mary, who is called my mother according to the material body. I spoke to 
her in the type of Gabriel , and when she turned to the height towards me, I 
cast into her the first power which I had received from the Barbelo, which is 
the body which I wore in the height. And in place of the soul, I cast into her 
the power which I received from the great Sabaoth, the Good , who is in the 
place of the right. And the twelve powers of the twelve saviours of the Treasury 
of the Light, which I received from the twelve servers which are in the Midst, I 
cast into the sphere of the archons. And the decans of the archons and their 
ministers thought that they were souls of the archons, and the ministers brought 
them, they bound them in the bodies of your mothers. And when your times were 
completed, they bore you into the world without there being souls of the archons 
in you. And you have received your parts from the power which the last helper 
(parastates) had breathed into the mixture, this (power) which is mixed with all 
the invisible ones and all the archons and all the aeons. In a word, it is mixed 
with the world of destruction, namely the mixture. </P>
<P>This (power) which, from the beginning, I brought out of myself, I cast into 
the first ordinance. And the first ordinance cast a part of it into the great 
light. And the great light cast a part of what it received into the five helpers 
(parastatai), and the last helper (parastates) took a part from what it received 
and cast it into the mixture. And (the part) has come to be in all who are in 
the mixture, as I have just said to you." Now Jesus was saying these things to 
his disciples upon the Mount of Olives. Jesus now continued again in the 
discourse with his disciples: "Rejoice and be glad , and add joy to your joy, 
because the times are completed that I should put on my garment which was 
prepared for me from the beginning, which I left behind in the last mystery 
until the time of its completion. But the time of its completion is the time 
when I am commanded by the First Mystery to speak to you from the beginning of 
the truth to its fulfillment, and from the innermost of the inner (to the 
outermost of the outer), because the world will be saved by you. Rejoice and be 
glad because you are blessed beyond all men upon earth, because it is you who 
will save the whole world.". </P>
<HR>

<P><STRONG>CHAPTER 9</STRONG> </P>
<P>It happened now when Jesus finished saying these words to his disciples, he 
continued again with the discourse, and he said to them : "Behold, I have put on 
my garment and all authority is given to me through the First Mystery. </P>
<P>Yet a little time, and I will tell you ( the mystery of the All and the 
pleroma of the All, and I will not hide anything from you from this hour, but in 
completion I will complete you in every pleroma and in every completion and in 
every mystery ; these are the completion of all completions and the Pleroma of 
all Pleromas and the gnosis of all gnoses, these which are in my garment. I will 
tell you all the mysteries from the outermost of the outer to the innermost of 
the inner. Hear, nevertheless, and I will tell you everything which has happened 
to me.</P>
<HR>

<P>CHAPTER 10. </P>
<P>It happened now when the sun rose in the East, a great power of light came 
down, in which was my garment which I had left in the 24th mystery, as I have 
just been telling you. And I found a mystery in my garment, written in the 
manner of writing of those of the height :&lt;lacuna untranslatable&gt; whose 
interpretation is : 'O Mystery which art outside the world , because of which 
the All exists - this is the whole coming forth and the whole ascent which has 
emanated all emanations and all that is within them, and because of which all 
mysteries and all their places exist - come forth to us because we are thy 
fellow-members. </P>
<P>But we all with thee alone, we and thou are one and the same. Thou art the 
First Mystery which has existed from the beginning in the Ineffable One, before 
he went forth, and the name of that one is all of us. Now all together we will 
approach thee at the last boundary , which is the last mystery from within, 
itself a part of us. Now we have sent thee thy garment which has belonged to 
thee from the beginning, which thou didst leave in the last boundary, which is 
the last mystery from within, until its time was completed according to the 
command of the First Mystery. </P>
<P>Behold, the time is completed. Put it on, come to us, that we all approach 
thee to put on thee the First Mystery with all his glory, through his own 
command; as the First Mystery, having two garments , has given it to us that we 
should put it on thee, apart from this which we have sent thee because thou art 
worthy, since thou art first among us and thou didst exist before us . Because 
of this the First Mystery has sent to thee through us the mystery of his whole 
glory, having two garments. That is, in the first is all the glory of all the 
names of all the mysteries and all the emanations and the ranks of the spaces of 
the Ineffable One. And in the second garment is the whole glory of the name of 
all the mysteries and all the emanations which are in the ranks of the two 
spaces of the First Mystery. And in this garment which we have now sent thee is 
the glory of the name of the mystery of the informer, which is the first 
ordinance, and the mystery of the five incisions, and the mystery of the great 
messenger of the Ineffable, who is the great light, and the mystery of the five 
leaders who are the five helpers (parastatai). And furthermore, there is in that 
garment the glory of the name of the mystery of all the ranks of the emanations 
of the Treasury of the Light, and their saviours, and (the mystery on the ranks 
of the ranks, which are the seven amens and the seven voices and the five trees 
and the three amens and the twin saviour, namely the child of the child, and the 
mystery of the nine watchers of the three gates of the Treasury of the Light . 
And furthermore there is in it the whole glory of the name (of all those) who 
are on the right, and all those who are in the Midst. And furthermore there is 
in it the whole glory of the name of the great invisible one, who is the great 
forefather , and the mystery of the triple power, and the mystery, of their 
whole place, and the mystery, of all their invisible ones and of all those who 
are in the thirteenth aeon , and the name of the twelve aeons and of all their 
archons and all their archangels and all their angels, and of all those which 
are in the twelve aeons, and the whole mystery, of the names of all those which 
are in the Heimarmene and all the heavens. </P>
<P>And the whole mystery of the name of all those in the sphere, and their 
firmaments and all those which are in them, and all their places. Behold now, we 
have sent thee that garment which no one knew, from the first ordinance 
downwards, because the glory of its light was hidden within it. And the spheres 
and all the places from the first ordinance downwards (did not know it). Behold 
now, put on this garment quickly. </P>
<P>Come to us that we approach thee to put on thee thy two garments, through the 
command of the First Mystery they having been for thee with the First Mystery 
since the beginning until the time appointed by the Ineffable One which 
contained their name. They were exceedingly afraid and all their bonds in which 
they were bound were loosened, and each one abandoned his rank. And they all 
prostrated themselves in my presence, they worshipped, saying : 'How has the 
Lord of the All passed through us without our knowing?' And they all sang 
praises at once to the innermost of the inner. However they did not see me, but 
they saw the light alone and they were in great fear . And they were greatly 
agitated, and they sang praises to the innermost of the inner.</P>
<HR>

<P><STRONG>CHAPTER 11</STRONG> </P>
<P>It happened now, when I saw the mystery, of all these words in the garment 
which was sent to me, I put it on in that hour, and I gave light exceedingly, 
and I flew to the height, and I came before the gate of the firmament, shining 
exceedingly, there being no measure to the light which I had. And the gates of 
the firmament were agitated against one another, and they all opened at the same 
time. </P>
<P>And all the archons and all the powers (exousiai) and all the angels therein 
were all agitated at the same time because of the great light which I had. And 
they looked upon the shining garment of light which I wore, they saw the mystery 
is completed. Behold the time is completed. Come now quickly to us that we put 
them on thee, until thou hast completed the whole service of the completion of 
the First Mystery, which is appointed by the Ineffable One. Come now quickly to 
us that we put them on thee, according to the command of the First Mystery. For 
yet a little time, an insignificant one, and thou wilt come to us and leave the 
world. Come now quickly, and thou shalt receive the whole glory which is the 
glory of the First Mystery ii. It happened now, when I saw the mystery, of all 
these words in the garment which was sent to me, I put it on in that hour, and I 
gave light exceedingly, and I flew to the height, and I came before the gate of 
the firmament, shining exceedingly, there being no measure to the light which I 
had. And the gates of the firmament were agitated against one another, and they 
all opened at the same time. </P>
<P>And all the archons and all the powers (exousiai) and all the angels therein 
were all agitated at the same time because of the great light which I had. And 
they looked upon the shining garment of light which I wore, they saw the mystery 
of their name within it. And they were increasingly agitated and they were in 
great fear, saying : "How has the Lord of the All passed through without our 
knowing?" And all their bonds were loosened, and their places and their ranks. 
</P>
<P>And each one abandoned his rank. And they all prostrated themselves at the 
same time, they all worshipped in my presence or in the presence of my garment. 
And they all sang praises at the same time to the innermost of the inner, being 
in great fear and great agitation.</P>
<HR>

<P><STRONG>CHAPTER 12.</STRONG> </P>
<P>Nevertheless I left that place behind me, I came up to the first sphere 
shining exceedingly, 49 times more than when I gave light within the firmament. 
Now it happened when I reached the gate of the first sphere, its gates were 
agitated and they opened of themselves at the same time. </P>
<P>I came into the houses of the spheres shining exceedingly, there being no 
measure to the light which I had. And all the archons and all those who were in 
that sphere were agitated together. And they saw the great light which I had. 
</P>
<P>And they looked upon my garment, they saw the mystery of their name within 
it. And they were increasingly agitated, and they were in great fear, saying: 
'How, has the Lord of the All passed through us without our knowing?' And all 
their bonds were loosened, and their places and their ranks. And each one 
abandoned his rank. And they all prostrated themselves at the same time, they 
all worshipped in my presence or in the presence of my garment. And they all 
sang praises at the same time to the innermost of the inner, being in great fear 
and great agitation. </P>
<P>.</P>
<HR>

<P><STRONG>CHAPTER 13.</STRONG> </P>
<P>And I left that place behind me, I came to the gate of the second sphere, 
which is the Heimarmene. But all its gates were agitated and they opened of 
themselves . And I entered into the houses of the Heimarmene, shining 
exceedingly, there being no measure to the light which I had, for I was shining 
in the Heimarmene 49 times more than in the sphere. And all the archons and all 
those who are in the Heimarmene were agitated and they fell upon one another, 
and were in very great fear as they saw the great light which I had. And they 
looked at my garment of light, they saw the mystery of their name in my garment, 
and they were increasingly agitated. They were in great fear, saying : 'How has 
the Lord of the All passed through us without our knowing?' And all the bonds of 
their places and their ranks and their houses were loosened. They all came at 
the same time, they prostrated themselves, they worshipped in my presence. And 
they all sang praises at the same time to the innermost of the inner, being in 
great fear and great agitation. </P>
<P>.</P>
<HR>

<P><STRONG>CHAPTER 14.</STRONG> </P>
<P>And I left that place behind me, I came upwards to the great aeons of the 
archons, I came before their veils and their gates shining exceedingly, and 
there was no measure to the light which I had. Now it happened when I reached 
the twelve aeons , their veils and their gates were agitated against one 
another. The veils drew themselves aside and the gates opened of themselves , 
and I entered into their aeons shining exceedingly, there being no measure to 
the light which I had, 49 times greater than the light with which I was shining 
in the houses of the Heimarmene. And all the angels of the aeons and their 
archangels and their archons and their gods and their lords and their powers 
(exousiai) and their tyrants and their powers and their light-sparks and their 
luminaries and their unpaired ones and their invisible ones and their 
forefathers and their triple-powered glories, they saw me shining exceedingly, 
there being no measure to the light which I had. And they were agitated against 
one another, and great fear came upon them as they saw the great light which I 
had. And their great agitation and their great fear reached to the place of the 
great invisible forefather and the three great triple-powered ones. However, 
because of the great fear from their agitation, the great forefather continued 
to run from side to side in his place, he and the three triple-powered ones, and 
they could not close all their places because of the great fear in which they 
were. And they moved all their aeons at the same time, and all their spheres, 
and all their orders, fearing and greatly agitated because of the great light 
which I had. Not as at the time when I had it, in which I was upon the earth of 
mankind, when the garment of light came down upon me, for the world would not be 
able to bear the light as it is in its reality, else the world and all that is 
upon it would be dissolved at the same time. But the light which I had in the 
twelve aeons was 8700 myriad times greater than that which I had with you in the 
world.</P>
<HR>

<P><STRONG>CHAPTER 15</STRONG>. </P>
<P>Now it happened when all those that were in the twelve aeons saw the great 
light which I had, they were all agitated against one another, and they ran from 
side to side in the aeons. And all the aeons and all the heavens and their whole 
order moved against one another, because of the great fear which they had 
because they did not know the mystery which had happened. And Adamas, the great 
tyrant , and all the tyrants which are in all the aeons began to wage war in 
vain against the light. And they did not know against whom they waged war, 
because they saw nothing except the greatly surpassing light. </P>
<P>Now it happened when they waged war against the light, they were all 
exhausted together, and they were cast down into the aeons, and they became like 
the earth-dwellers who are dead and have no breath in them. And I took a third 
part of all their power so that they should not work their wicked actions, and 
in order that when men who are in the world call upon them in their mysteries - 
those which the transgressing angels brought down, namely their magic - that 
when now they call upon them in their wicked actions, they are not able to 
complete them. And (as for) the Heimarmene and the sphere over which they rule, 
I turned them and caused them to spend six months turned to the left, as they 
complete their (periods of) influence, and to look to the right for six months, 
as they complete their (periods on influence. However, through the command of 
the first ordinance and through the command of the First Mystery, Jeu the 
Overseer of the Light had placed them so that they were looking to the left at 
all times, as they completed their (periods of) influence and their actions.</P>
<HR>

<P><STRONG>CHAPTER 16</STRONG> </P>
<P>Now it happened when I came to their place, they rebelled and waged war 
against the light. And I took a third part of their power, so that they should 
not be able to complete their wicked actions. And (as for) the Heimarmene and 
the sphere over which they rule, I turned them, I placed them looking to the 
left for six months, as they complete their (periods of) influence, and I placed 
them for another six months turning to the right, as they complete their 
(periods of) influence.</P>

<P><STRONG>CHAPTER 17</STRONG>. </P>
<P>Now when he had said these things to his disciples, he said to them : "He who 
has ears to hear, let him hear" . </P>
<P>Now it happened when Mariam heard these words as the Saviour was saying them, 
she stared for one hour into the air and said : "My Lord, command me that I 
speak openly". </P>
<P>Jesus, the compassionate, answered and said to Mariam : "Mariam, thou blessed 
one, whom I will complete in all the mysteries of the height, speak openly, thou 
art she whose heart is more directed to the Kingdom of Heaven than all thy 
brothers". </P>
<HR>

<P><STRONG>CHAPTER 18.</STRONG> </P>
<P>Then Mariam said to the Saviour: "My Lord, the word which thou hast spoken to 
us : 'Who has ears to hear, let him hear', thou sayest so that we may understand 
the word which thou hast spoken. Hear now, my Lord, for I will speak openly. The 
word which thou hast spoken: 'I have taken a third part of the power of the 
archons of all the aeons, and I have turned their Heimarmene and their sphere 
over which they rule, so that when the race of mankind call upon them in their 
mysteries - these which the transgressing angels have taught them for the 
completion of their evil and iniquitous deeds in the mystery of their magic - 
from this hour now they should not be able to complete their iniquitous deeds, 
because thou hast taken their power from them and from their astrologers and 
from their soothsayers and from those who tell men who are in the world all 
things which will happen, so that from this hour they will not understand 
anything which will happen so as to tell it. For thou hast turned their sphere, 
and thou hast made them spend six months turned to the left, completing their 
(periods of) influence, and six months looking to the right, completing their 
(periods of) influence.' Now concerning this word, my Lord, the power within the 
prophet Isaiah has spoken thus and has related once in a spiritual parable, 
speaking about the vision of Egypt : 'Where now Egypt, where are thy soothsayers 
and thy astrologers, and those who call from the earth, and those who call from 
their bellies? Let them now tell thee, from this hour, the things which the Lord 
Sabaoth will do.' Now before thou didst come, the power within Isaiah, the 
prophet, prophesied concerning thee, that thou wouldst take away the power of 
the archons of the aeons, and that thou wouldst turn their sphere and their 
Heimarmene, so that from this hour they would know nothing. Concerning this also 
it has said : 'You will not know what the Lord Sabaoth will do'. That is, none 
of the archons will know what things thou wilt do from this hour. They (the 
archons) are Egypt, because they are matter. The power within Isaiah has once 
prophesied about thee saying : 'You will not know from this hour what the Lord 
Sabaoth will do' Concerning the power of light which thou hast taken from 
Sabaoth the Good, who is in the place of the right, and which today is in thy 
material body, concerning this now, thou hast said to us, my Lord Jesus: 'He who 
has ears to hear, let him hear, so that thou shouldst know whose heart is 
directed towards the Kingdom of Heaven.".</P>

<P><STRONG>CHAPTER 19.</STRONG> </P>
<P>Now it happened when Maria finished saying these words, he said : "Excellent, 
Maria. Thou art blessed beyond all women upon earth, because thou shalt be the 
pleroma of all Pleromas and the completion of all completions." But when Maria 
heard the Saviour saying these words, she rejoiced greatly and she came before 
Jesus, she prostrated herself in his presence, she worshipped at his feet, she 
said to him : "My Lord, hear me that I question thee on this word before thou 
speakest with us of the places to which thou hast gone". </P>
<P>Jesus answered and said to Mariam : "Speak openly and do not fear. I will 
reveal all things which thou seekest".</P>
<HR>

<P><STRONG>CHAPTER 20.</STRONG> </P>
<P>She said : "My Lord, all men who know the mystery of the magic of all the 
archons of all the aeons, and the magic of the archons of the Heimarmene and 
those of the sphere, as the transgressing angels have taught them, when they 
call upon them in their mysteries, that is their evil magic to prevent good 
things: will they, from this hour, fulfill them or not?" Then Jesus answered and 
said to Maria : "They will not fulfill them in the manner in which they 
fulfilled them from the beginning, because I have taken a third part of their 
power. But they will borrow from those who know the mysteries of the magic of 
the third aeon. And when they call upon the mysteries of the magic of those who 
are in the third aeon, they will fulfill them well and certainly because I have 
not taken power from that place, according to the command of the First 
Mystery".</P>
<HR>

<P><STRONG>CHAPTER 21.</STRONG> </P>
<P>It happened, however, when Jesus finished speaking these words, Maria 
answered again and said : "My Lord, will the astrologers and the soothsayers not 
tell men, from this hour, what will happen?" Jesus answered, however, and said 
to Maria : "When the astrologers find the Heimarmene and the sphere turned to 
the left, according to their first distribution, then their words concur and 
they will say what is due to happen. But when they meet the Heimarmene or the 
sphere turned to the right, they do not speak anything of the truth, because I 
have turned their (periods of) influence and their quadrangles and their 
triangles and their figures of eight , since their (periods of) influence 
remained turned to the left from the beginning, together with their quadrangles 
and their triangles and their figures of eight. However, I have now caused them 
to spend six months turned to the left, and six months turned to the right. He 
who now will find their reckoning from the time when I turned them, placing them 
to spend six months looking to their left hand parts, and six months looking to 
their right hand paths, and who will now consult them in this way, will know 
their (periods of) influence with certainty, and he will predict all things that 
they will do. </P>
<P>Likewise also the soothsayers, when they call upon the name of the archons, 
and they meet them looking to the left, everything concerning which they will 
seek of their decans, they will tell them with certainty. However, when their 
soothsayers call upon their names as they are looking to the right, they will 
not hear them, because they look in another form than their first ordinance in 
which Jeu established them, since their names are other when they are turned to 
the left than when they are turned to the right. And when they call upon them as 
they are turned to the right, they will not speak the truth to them, but in 
confusion they will confuse them, and with threats they will threaten them. </P>
<P>Those now who do not know their paths as they are turned to the right, with 
their triangles and their quadrangles and all their figures, they will find 
nothing of truth, but they will be confused in great confusion, and they will be 
in great error, and they will be deluded in great delusion, because the works 
which they did in the time when they were turned to the left in their 
quadrangles, in their triangles and in their figures of eight, these in which 
they continued as they were turned to the left, I have now turned. And I have 
caused them to spend six months making all their patterns turned to the right, 
so that they should be confused in confusion in their whole circuit. And 
furthermore I have caused them to spend six months turned to the left, doing the 
works of their (periods of) influence and all their patterns, so that the 
archons which are in the aeons and in their spheres and in their heavens and in 
all their places should be confused in confusion, and should wander in error, so 
that they should not understand their own paths".</P>
<HR>

<P><STRONG>CHAPTER 22.</STRONG> </P>
<P>It happened when Jesus finished saying these words, Philip sat writing every 
word as Jesus said them. Now after this it happened that Philip came forward, he 
prostrated himself and worshipped at the feet of Jesus, saying : "My Lord, 
Saviour, give me authority that I speak in thy presence and that I question thee 
on this discourse before thou speakest with us of the places to which thou hast 
gone for the sake of thy service". </P>
<P>The compassionate Saviour answered, he said to Philip : "The authority is 
given to thee to deliver the discourse which thou dost wish". </P>
<P>Then Philip answered and spoke to Jesus: "My Lord, for the sake of what 
mystery hast thou turned the bondage of the archons and their aeons and their 
Heimarmene and their sphere and all their places, and in confusion hast thou 
caused them to be confused in their paths, and to wander in their course? Hast 
thou now done this for the sake of the salvation of the world or not?". </P>
<HR>

<P><STRONG>CHAPTER 23</STRONG>. </P>
<P>Jesus answered, however, and said to Philip and all the disciples together : 
"I have turned their paths for the salvation of all souls. Truly, truly, I say 
to you : unless I had turned their paths a multitude of souls would have been 
destroyed. And they would have spent a long period if the archons of the aeons 
and the archons of the Heimarmene and the sphere and all their places and all 
their heavens and all their aeons were not dissolved. And the souls would have 
spent a great (period of) time outside. And there would have been delay in the 
completion of the number of perfect souls, which will be accounted among the 
inheritance of the height, through the mysteries, and will be in the Treasury of 
Light. Because of this, I have turned their paths so that they are confused and 
agitated, and give up the power which is in the matter of their world, which 
they make into souls, so that those that will be saved with all the power are 
purified quickly and ascend, and those who will not be saved are quickly 
dissolved". </P>
<HR>

<P><STRONG>CHAPTER 24.</STRONG> </P>
<P>It happened now when Jesus finished speaking these words to his disciples, 
Maria, the beautiful in her speech, came forward. The blessed one prostrated 
herself at the feet of Jesus and said : "My Lord, suffer me that I speak in thy 
presence, and be not angry with me because I trouble thee many times, 
questioning thee". The Saviour answered compassionately, he said to Maria: 
"Speak the discourse which thou dost wish, and I will reveal it to thee openly"" 
Maria answered and said to Jesus : "'My Lord, in what manner would the souls be 
delayed outside or in what form will they be quickly purified?" .</P>
<HR>

<P><STRONG>CHAPTER 25.</STRONG> </P>
<P>However Jesus answered and said to Maria : "Excellent, Maria. Thou dost ask 
well with an excellent question and thou dost seek everything with certainty and 
with accuracy. Now indeed I will not conceal anything from you from this hour, 
but I will reveal everything to you with certainty and openly. Hear now, Maria, 
and give ear, all you disciples. </P>
<P>Before I preached to all the archons of the aeons, and all the archons of the 
Heimarmene and the sphere, they were all bound with their bonds, in their 
spheres and their seals, according to the manner in which Jeu, the Overseer of 
the Light, had bound them from the beginning. And each one of them was 
continuing in his rank and each one was proceeding according to his course, 
according to the manner in which Jeu, the Overseer of the Light, had settled it. 
And when the time came of the number of Melchizedek, the great Paralemptor of 
Light, he came to the midst of the aeons, and to all the archons which were 
bound in the sphere and in the Heimarmene, and he took away what is purified of 
the light from all the archons of the aeons, and from all the archons of the 
Heimarmene, and from those of the sphere, for he took away that which agitated 
them. </P>
<P>And he moved the hastener that is over them and made their cycles turn 
quickly, and he (Melchizedek) took away their power which was in them, and the 
breath of their mouths, and the tears of their eyes, and the sweat of their 
bodies. And Melchizedek, the Paralemptor of the Light, purified those powers, he 
carried their light to the Treasury of the Light. And all their matter was 
gathered together by the ministers of all the archons. And the ministers of all 
the archons of the Heimarmene and the ministers of the sphere which are below 
the aeons took them (the matter) and made them into souls of men and cattle and 
reptiles and beasts and birds. And they sent them to this world of mankind. </P>
<P>And furthermore the paralemptors of the sun and the paralemptors of the moon 
when they looked up and they saw the patterns of the paths of the aeons, and the 
patterns of the Heimarmene and those of the sphere, they took the light-power 
from them. And the paralemptors of the sun prepared to lay it down until they 
gave it to the paralemptor of Melchizedek, the purifier of the light. And their 
material dregs they brought to the sphere which is below the aeons, and they 
made it into the souls of men and they also made it into (souls of) reptiles and 
cattle and beasts and birds, according to the cycle of the archons of that 
sphere, and according to all the patterns of its revolution. And they cast them 
into this world of mankind, and they became souls in that place, according to 
what I have just told you.</P>
<HR>

<P><STRONG>CHAPTER 26</STRONG> These things were now fully completed before 
their power diminished within them, and they declined and they weakened or they 
became powerless. It happened when they became weak, their power began to cease 
within them, and they became weak in their power. And their light, which was in 
their place, ceased. And their kingdom dissolved. </P>
<P>And the All was quickly carried up. </P>
<P>It happened now when these things in their time were known, and when the 
number of the cipher of Melchizedek, the Paralemptor (of the Light), occurred, 
he came forth, and he went into the midst of the archons of all the aeons, and 
to the midst of all the archons of the Heimarmene and those of the sphere. And 
he agitated them, and he caused them quickly to abandon their circles, and 
immediately they were afflicted, and they cast the power out of themselves, out 
of the breath of their mouths, and out of the tears of their eyes, and out of 
the sweat of their bodies. And Melchizedek, the Paralemptor of the Light 
purified them, according to the manner in which he did so continually. And he 
took their light to the Treasury of the Light. And the matter of their dregs was 
surrounded and swallowed by all the archons of the aeons and the archons of the 
Heimarmene and those of the sphere, and they did not allow them to go and become 
souls in the world. They now swallowed their matter, that they might not become 
powerless and weak, that their power might not cease within them and their 
rulership (kingdom) dissolve. And they swallowed them so that they should not 
dissolve, but that they should be retarded, and should spend a great time until 
the completion of the number of perfect souls which would be in the Treasury of 
the Light.</P>
<HR>

<P><STRONG>CHAPTER 27.</STRONG> </P>
<P>It happened now as the archons of the aeons and those of the Heimarmene and 
those of the sphere continued acting after this type; as they turned themselves 
they ate the dregs of their matter, they did not allow them to become souls in 
the world of mankind, so that they might be retarded as rulers. And the powers, 
namely the powers within them which were souls, spent a great time outside this. 
Now these remained making two cycles continually. </P>
<P>It happened now when I came to go forth for the service for the sake of which 
I was appointed, through the command of the First Mystery, I came forth to the 
midst of the tyrants of the archons of the twelve aeons. And my garment of light 
was upon me, and I was shining exceedingly, there being no measure to the light 
which I had. </P>
<P>Now it happened, when those tyrants saw the great light which I had, the 
great Adamas, the Tyrant, and all the tyrants of the twelve aeons all began to 
wage war with the light of my garment, wishing to restrain it for themselves, so 
that they might still be retarded in their rulership (kingdom). These now acted 
thus, not knowing with whom they waged war. When they now rebelled and waged war 
with the light, I then turned the paths and the courses of their aeons, and the 
paths of their Heimarmene and their sphere, according to the command of the 
First Mystery, and I caused them to spend six months looking to the triangles of 
the left, and to the quadrangles, and to those in their aspect , and to their 
pattern of eight, according to the manner in which they were at first. But I 
turned their rotation or their aspect to another rank. And I caused them to 
spend another six months looking to the works of their (periods of) influence in 
the quadrangles of the right, and in their triangles, and in those which are in 
their aspect, and in their pattern of eight. And I caused the archons of the 
aeons to be confused with much confusion, and I caused them to wander in error, 
together with all the archons of the Heimarmene and those of the sphere. And I 
agitated them greatly. And they were now, from this time, not able to turn 
themselves to the dregs of their matter in order to swallow it, so that their 
places might be continually retarded, and so that they might spend a great time 
as rulers. But when I had taken a third part of their power, I turned their 
sphere to cause them to spend (a period of) time looking to the left and to 
spend another (period of) time looking to the right. I turned their whole path 
and their whole course, and I caused the path of their course to be accelerated, 
so that they might be purified quickly, and they might go upwards quickly. And I 
lessened their cycles, and I made their path easier, and it was greatly 
accelerated, and they were confused in their path, and from this time they were 
not able to swallow the matter of the dregs of what is purified of their light. 
And further I lessened their times and their periods, so that the perfect number 
of souls which will receive mysteries and which will be in the Treasury of the 
Light should be completed quickly. And unless I had turned their courses and 
unless I had lessened their periods, they would not have allowed any souls to 
come to the world, on account of the matter of their dregs which they swallowed, 
and they would have destroyed a multitude of souls. On account of this now, I 
have said to you at this time : 'I have lessened the times for the sake of my 
chosen ones, otherwise none of the souls could have been saved'. But I have 
lessened the times and the periods for the sake of the perfect number of the 
souls which will receive mysteries, which are the chosen ones. And had I not 
lessened their periods, none of the material souls would have been saved, but 
they would have been consumed in the fire which is in the flesh of the archons. 
This now is the discourse on which you have questioned me with accuracy". </P>
<P>It happened, however, when Jesus finished saying these words to his 
disciples, they all prostrated themselves at once, they worshipped him and they 
said to him : "We are blessed beyond all men, for thou hast revealed to us these 
great events". </P>
<P>.</P>
<HR>

<P><STRONG>CHAPTER 28.</STRONG> </P>
<P>Jesus continued again with the discourse, he said to his disciples : "Hear 
[hear] concerning the things which happened to me among the archons of the 
twelve aeons, and all their archons and their lords and their powers (exousiai) 
and their angels and their archangels. Now when they saw the garment of light 
which was upon me, they and their unpaired ones, each one of them saw the 
mystery of his name which was in the garment of light which was upon me. They 
all prostrated themselves together, they worshipped the garment of light which 
was upon me. And they all cried out at once, saying : 'How has the Lord of All 
passed through us without our knowing?' And they all sang praises at once to the 
innermost of the inner. And all their triple-powered ones and their great 
forefathers and their unbegotten ones and their self-begotten ones and their 
begotten ones and their gods and their light-sparks and their luminaries, in a 
word, all their great ones saw the tyrants of their place, that their power was 
diminished within them, and that they were in a state of weakness. And they were 
in great fear, to which there was no measure. And they contemplated the mystery 
of their name in my garment and they tried to come to worship the mystery of 
their name in my garment, and they were not able, on account of the great light 
which I had. </P>
<P>But they worshipped at a little distance from me. However, they worshipped 
the light of my garment, and they all cried out at once as they sang praises to 
the innermost of the inner. </P>
<P>It happened moreover, when these things happened to the tyrants which are 
among the archons, they were all enfeebled, they fell down in their aeons, and 
they became like men of this world who are dead, having no breath within them, 
as they did moreover at the time when I took away their power from them. </P>
<P>It happened now after this, when I came forth from those aeons, each one of 
all those who are in the twelve aeons were all bound within their ranks, and 
they completed their works according to the manner in which I had disposed it, 
that they should spend six months turned to the left, doing their works in their 
quadrangles, and their triangles and those in their aspects; and furthermore 
that they should spend another six months looking to the right, and to their 
triangles and their quadrangles and those in their aspects. </P>
<P>Furthermore, this is the manner in which those who are in the Heimarmene and 
the sphere will proceed.</P>
<HR>

<P><STRONG>CHAPTER 29.</STRONG> </P>
<P>Now it happened after these things I came to the height to the veils of the 
thirteenth aeon. Now it happened that when I reached their veils, they drew 
themselves and they opened to me. I entered into the thirteenth aeon, I found 
the Pistis Sophia below the thirteenth aeon alone, none of them being with her. 
But she dwelt in that place, sorrow and grieving because she had not been taken 
to the thirteenth aeon, her place in the height. And furthermore she was 
sorrowful on account of the torments which the Authades inflicted on her, he 
being one of the three triple- powered ones. But when I tell you about their 
extent, I will tell you the mystery of how these things happened. </P>
<P>Now it happened, when the Pistis Sophia saw me shining exceedingly, there 
being no measure to the light which I had, she was in great agitation and she 
looked at the light of my garment. She saw the mystery of her name in my garment 
and the whole glory of its mystery because she was previously in the place of 
the height in the thirteenth aeon. But she was wont to sing praises to the light 
in the height which she saw in the veil of the Treasure of the Light. </P>
<P>It happened now when she continued to sing praises to the light in the 
height, all the archons, which are with the two great triple-powered ones, 
looked on, and also her invisible one which is paired with her, and the other 22 
invisible emanations - since the Pistis Sophia with her partner, with the other 
22 emanations make up the 24 emanations , which the great invisible forefather 
with the two great triple-powered ones has emanated." .</P>
<HR>

<P>CHAPTER 30. </P>
<P>It happened now when Jesus said these things to his disciples, Mariam came 
forward and said : "My Lord, I heard thee at the time when thou didst say that 
the Pistis Sophia herself is one of the 24 emanations. How is she not in their 
place? Moreover thou hast said : 'I found her below the thirteenth aeon'." Jesus 
answered and said to his disciples : "It happened as the Pistis Sophia was in 
the thirteenth aeon in the place of all her brethren, the invisible ones who are 
the 24 emanations of the great invisible one it happened now, through the 
ordinance of the First Mystery, the Pistis Sophia looked to the height, she saw 
the light of the veil of the Treasury of the Light, and she desired to go to 
that place. </P>
<P>And she was not able to go to that place. Moreover she ceased performing the 
mystery of the thirteenth aeon, but she sang praises to the light of the height 
which she saw in the light of the veil of the Treasury of the Light. </P>
<P>Now it happened, as she sang praises to the place of the height, all the 
archons which are in the twelve aeons beneath hated her because she ceased from 
their mystery, and because she wished to go to the height and to make herself 
above them all. Now on account of these things they were angry with her, and 
they hated her. And the great triple-powered Authades - the third triple-powered 
one who is in the thirteenth aeon, who had been disobedient - had not emanated 
all that was purified of his inner power, nor had he given what was purified of 
his light at the time when the archons had given their purification, and he had 
wished to be lord over the whole thirteenth aeon and those beneath it. Now it 
happened when the archons of the thirteenth aeon were angry at the Pistis 
Sophia, who was above them, they hated her greatly. And the great triple-powered 
Authades, about whom I have just been speaking to you now, was also included 
among the archons of the twelve aeons, and he also was angry at the Pistis 
Sophia, and he hated her greatly, because she thought to go to the light which 
was above him. And he emanated from within himself a great lion-faced power. And 
from out of the matter within him, he emanated forth a further multitude of 
material emanations which were very powerful. And he sent them to the places 
below, to the parts of the Chaos, so that they should pursue the Pistis Sophia 
there and take her power from her, because she thought to go to the height which 
is above them all, and because she ceased to perform their mystery, but she 
remained sorrowing, seeking the light which she saw. And the archons which 
continued or persisted in performing the mystery hated her. And all the watchers 
which were at the gates of the aeons also hated her. </P>
<P>It happened now after this, through the ordinance of the first ordinance, the 
great triple-powered Authades, -who is one of the three triple-powered ones, 
persecuted the 'Sophia in the thirteenth aeon, so that she should look at the 
parts below, so that she should see in that place his light power, which has a 
lion-face, and she should desire it, and come to that place, and her light would 
be taken from her. </P>
<P>.</P>
<HR>

<P><STRONG>CHAPTER 31.</STRONG> </P>
<P>It happened now after this she looked down. She saw his power of light in the 
parts below, and she did not know that it was that of the triple-powered 
Authades. But she thought that it was from the light which she had seen from the 
beginning in the height, which was from the veil of the Treasury of the Light. 
And she thought to herself : "I will go to that place without my partner, and 
take the light, and create of it for myself aeons of light, so that I shall be 
able to go to the Light of Lights which is in the highest height." Now as she 
was thinking these things, she came forth from her place in the thirteenth aeon, 
and she came out to the twelve aeons . The archons of the aeons persecuted her, 
and they were angry with her, because she had thought to have greatness . 
However, she came forth from the twelve aeons, she came to the places of the 
Chaos. And she made her way to the light-power with a lion-face in order to 
swallow it. But all the material emanations of the Authades surrounded her. And 
the great light-power with a lion-face swallowed the light-powers in the Sophia. 
And it purified her light and swallowed it, and her matter was cast forth to the 
Chaos. There existed an archon with a lion- face in the Chaos, whose one half 
was fire and whose other half was darkness, namely Jaldabaoth, of whom I have 
spoken to you many times. Now when these things had happened, the Sophia became 
very greatly weakened. And again that light-power with a lion-face began to take 
away all the light-powers from the Sophia. And all the material powers of the 
Authades surrounded the Sophia at the same time, they oppressed her.</P>
<HR>

<P><STRONG>CHAPTER 32</STRONG>. </P>
<P>The Pistis Sophia cried out very much. She cried out to the Light of Lights 
which she had seen from the beginning, in which she had believed, and she said 
this repentance, speaking thus : </P>
<P>1. 'O Light of Lights, in whom I have believed from the beginning, hear my 
repentance now at this time, O Light; save me, O Light, for wicked thoughts have 
entered into me. </P>
<P>2. I looked, O Light, to the parts below. I saw a light in that place, and I 
thought : I will go to that place to receive that light. And I went, and I came 
to be in the darkness which is in the Chaos below. And I was not able to proceed 
out to go to my place, because I was oppressed among all the emanations of the 
Authades. And the lion-faced power took away my inner light. </P>
<P>3. And I cried out for help, and my voice did not penetrate the darkness. And 
I looked to the height, so that the Light in which I had believed might help me. 
</P>
<P>4. And when I looked to the height, I saw all the archons of the aeons , that 
they were numerous and they looked down upon me, rejoicing over me, although I 
had done nothing evil to them, but they had hated me without cause. </P>
<P>And when the emanations of the Authades saw the archons of the aeons 
rejoicing over me, they knew that the archons of the aeons would not help me. 
And those emanations which oppressed me without cause were encouraged. And they 
took from me the light which I did not take from them. 5. Now at this time, O 
true Light, thou knowest that I have done these things in my simplicity, 
thinking that the lion-faced light belonged to thee, and the sin which I have 
committed is manifest in thy presence. </P>
<P>6. Do not now let me be lacking, O Lord, for I have believed in thy light 
from the beginning, O Lord, Light of the powers, do not let me now lack my 
light. </P>
<P>7. For on account of thee and thy light I have come to be in this oppression, 
and shame has covered me. </P>
<P>8. And because of the delusion of thy light, I have become a stranger to my 
brothers, the invisible ones, and also to the great emanations of the Barbelo. 
</P>
<P>9. These things happened to me, O Light, because I was eager for thy 
dwelling-place. And the anger of the Authades came down upon me - this one who 
did not obey thy command to emanate from the emanation of his power - because I 
was in his aeon and not performing his mystery. </P>
<P>10. And all the archons of the aeons mocked me. </P>
<P>11. And I was in that place, sorrowing and seeking the light which I had seen 
in the height. </P>
<P>12. And the watchers of the gates of the aeons were seeking me, and all those 
who continued in their mystery mocked me. 13. But I looked up to the height to 
thee, O Light. And I believed in thee. Now at this time, O Light of Lights, I am 
oppressed in the darkness of the Chaos. If now thou dost wish to come to save me 
- great is thy compassion - hear me truly and save me. </P>
<P>14. Save me out of the matter of this darkness, so that I shall not be 
immersed in it, and that I shall be saved from the emanations of the deity, 
Authades, which oppress me, and from their evils. </P>
<P>15. Do not allow this darkness to immerse me, and do not allow this 
lion-faced power to swallow up all my power completely. And do not allow this 
Chaos to cover over my power. </P>
<P>16. Hear me O Light, for thy mercy is precious, and look down upon me, 
according to the great compassion of thy light. </P>
<P>17. Do not turn away thy face from me, for I am greatly afflicted. </P>
<P>18. Hear me quickly and save my power. </P>
<P>19. Save me, on account of the archons which hate me, for thou knowest my 
affliction and my torment, and the torment of my power which they have taken 
from me. </P>
<P>Those who have put me into all these evils are in thy presence. Deal with 
them according to thy will. </P>
<P>20. My power looked forth from the midst of the Chaos, and from the midst of 
the darkness. I looked for my partner, that he should come and fight for me, and 
he did not come. And I looked that he should come and give power to me, and I 
did not find him. </P>
<P>21. And when I sought for light, I was given darkness. </P>
<P>And when I sought for my power, I was given matter . </P>
<P>22. Now at this time, O Light of Lights, let the darkness and the matter 
which the emanations of the Authades have brought upon me become a snare for 
them, and let them be ensnared therein. And do thou repay them and bring 
disgrace upon them, so that they do not come to the place of their Authades. 
</P>
<P>23. Let them remain in darkness and not see the light. </P>
<P>Let them look at the Chaos at all times, and do not let them look at the 
height. </P>
<P>24. Bring down upon them their vengeance, and let thy judgment seize them. 
</P>
<P>25. Do not let them go to their place from this time, to their deity, 
Authades. And do not let his emanations go to their places from this time. 
Because their god is impious and insolent, because he thought that he had done 
these wicked things of himself, not knowing that, unless I was humbled according 
to thy ordinance, he would have had no power over me. </P>
<P>26. But when thou didst humble me, according to thy ordinance, I was 
persecuted the more. And their emanations inflicted torments upon my 
humiliation. 27. And they took a light-power from me. And furthermore they began 
to torment me greatly , in order to take away all the light that was in me. On 
account of these things into which I was put, do not let them go up to the 
thirteenth aeon, the place of righteousness. </P>
<P>28. And do not let them be numbered within the portion of those who purify 
themselves and their light. And do not let them be numbered among those who will 
repent quickly, so that they will quickly receive mysteries in the light. </P>
<P>29. For they have taken my light from me. And my power has begun to decrease 
within me. And I lack my light. </P>
<P>30. Now at this time, O Light which art in thee and with me, I sing praises 
to thy name, O Light, in glory. </P>
<P>31. And may my song of praise, O Light, please thee, like an excellent 
mystery which is received into the gates of light, which those who will repent, 
will recite, and whose light they will purify. </P>
<P>32. Now at this time, let all material things rejoice; seek the light, all of 
you, so that the power of your souls, which is within you, may live. </P>
<P>33. Because the Light has heard the material things, and it will not leave 
any material things which it has not purified. </P>
<P>34. Let the souls and the material things bless the Lord of all the aeons ; 
the material things and all things in them. 35. For God will save their souls 
out of all matter, and a city will be prepared in the light; and all souls which 
will be saved will dwell in that city, and they will inherit it. </P>
<P>36. And the soul of those who will receive mysteries will be in that place, 
and they who have received mysteries in his name will be within it'." .</P>

<P><STRONG>CHAPTER 33.</STRONG> </P>
<P>Now it happened, as Jesus said these words to his disciples, he said to them 
: "This is the song of praise which the Pistis Sophia spoke in the first 
repentance, as she repented for her sin. And she spoke of all the things which 
had happened to her. Now at this time, he who has ears to hear, let him hear ." 
Maria came forward again and said : "My Lord, there are ears to my man of light 
, and I hear in my light-power, and thy Spirit, which is with me, has made me 
sober. Hear now, that I may speak concerning the repentance which the Pistis 
Sophia said, as she spoke of her sin, and all the things which had happened to 
her. Thy light-power once prophesied about it through David, the prophet, in the 
68th Psalm : </P>
<P>1. 'Save me, O God, for the waters have come in to my soul. </P>
<P>2. I have sunk or been immersed by the mire of the abyss, and there was no 
power. I came to the depths of the sea ; a storm wind overwhelmed me. </P>
<P>3. I have suffered as I cried out. My throat has gone. My eyes have failed as 
I waited upon God. </P>
<P>4. Those who hate me without cause have become more numerous than the hairs 
of my head. My enemies that persecute me with violence have become strong. They 
deprived me of those things which I did not steal. </P>
<P>5. O God, thou knowest my foolishness; and my sins are not hidden from thee. 
</P>
<P>6. Let not them that wait on thee be ashamed on my account, O Lord, Lord of 
the powers. Let not those that seek thee be put to shame on my account, O Lord, 
God of Israel, God of the powers. </P>
<P>7. For I have borne disgrace on thy account; shame has covered my face. </P>
<P>8. I have become a stranger to my brothers, a stranger to the sons of my 
mother. </P>
<P>9. For the zeal of thy house has eaten me up. The reproaches of those who 
reproach thee have fallen upon me. </P>
<P>10. I bowed down my soul with fasting; it became a reproach to me. </P>
<P>11. I put sackcloth upon myself; I became a proverb to them. </P>
<P>12. They that sat in the gates talked against me ; and they that drink wine 
sang against me. </P>
<P>13. But I was praying in my soul to thee, O Lord ; it is the time of thy 
pleasure, O God ; in the magnitude of thy mercy, hear truly for my salvation. 
</P>
<P>14. Save me from this mire, that I do not sink in it. Let me be saved from 
those that hate me and from the depths of the waters. </P>
<P>15. Let not the water flood immerse me. Let not the abyss swallow me up ; let 
not a pit close its mouth over me. </P>
<P>16. Hear me, O Lord, for beneficent is thy mercy; according to the magnitude 
of thy compassion look down upon me. </P>
<P>17. Turn not away thy face from thy servant, for I am afflicted. </P>
<P>18. Hear me quickly; give heed to my soul and save it. </P>
<P>19. Save me on account of my enemies; for thou knowest my reproach and my 
shame and my infamy. All that afflict me are before thee. </P>
<P>20. My heart has looked for reproach and wretchedness ; I have looked for one 
to be sorrowful with me, I did not find him ; and for one to comfort me, I did 
not meet him. </P>
<P>21. They gave me gall for my food; they made me drink vinegar for my thirst. 
</P>
<P>22. Let their table become a snare in their presence; and a stumbling block 
and a retribution and a disgrace. 23. Do thou bend their backs at all times. 
</P>
<P>24. Pour out upon them thy wrath, and let the fury of thy wrath take hold of 
them. </P>
<P>25. Let their dwelling-place be made desolate and let there be no inhabitant 
in their dwelling-places. </P>
<P>26. For they have persecuted him whom thou hast smitten ; they have added to 
the pain of their blow . </P>
<P>27. They have added iniquity to their iniquities; let them not come into thy 
righteousness. </P>
<P>28. Let them be effaced from the book of the living, and let them not be 
written with the righteous. </P>
<P>29. I am a poor man and also a sorrowful one; the salvation of thy face, O 
God, is that which has accepted me. </P>
<P>30. I will bless the name of God in song, and raise him up in blessing. </P>
<P>31. It will please God more than a young bull which carries horns and hoofs. 
</P>
<P>32. Let the poor see and rejoice ; seek God that your souls may live. </P>
<P>33. For the Lord has heard the poor and he has not despised those in fetters 
. </P>
<P>34. Let the heavens and the earth bless the Lord, the sea and all that are 
within it. 35. For God will save Zion ; and the cities of Judaea will be built, 
and (men) will dwell there and inherit it. </P>
<P>36. The seed of his servants will take possession of it, and they that love 
his name will dwell in it'." .</P>

<P>Now it happened when Mariam finished saying these words to Jesus in the midst 
of the disciples, she said to him ; "My Lord, this is the interpretation of the 
mystery of the repentance of the Pistis Sophia". </P>
<P>It happened now when Jesus heard Mariam saying these words, he said to her : 
"Excellent, Mariam, thou blessed one, thou Pleroma or thou all-blessed Pleroma, 
who will be blessed among all generations" .</P>
<HR>

<P><STRONG>CHAPTER 35.</STRONG> </P>
<P>Jesus continued again with the discourse. He said : "The Pistis Sophia 
continued again, she also sang a second repentance, in which she spoke thus : 
</P>
<P>1. 'O Light of Lights, I have believed in thee. Do not leave me in the 
darkness until the completion of my time. </P>
<P>2. Help me and save me in thy mysteries. Incline thy ear to me and save me. 
</P>
<P>3. Let the power of thy light save me and carry me to the aeons on high, for 
it is thou who savest me and takest me to the height of thy aeons. 4. Save me, O 
Light, from the hand of this lion-faced power, and from the hands of the 
emanations of the deity, Authades. </P>
<P>5. For thou, O Light, art the one in whose light I have believed and in whose 
light I have trusted from the beginning. </P>
<P>6. And I have believed in it from the hour that it emanated me forth. And 
thou indeed art he who caused me to be emanated forth. And I have indeed 
believed in thy light from the beginning. </P>
<P>7. And when I believed in thee, the archons of the aeons mocked me, saying : 
she has ceased in her mystery. It is thou who wilt save me. And thou art my 
Saviour. And thou art my mystery, O Light. </P>
<P>8. My mouth has been filled with glory, so that I might tell the mystery of 
thy greatness at all times. </P>
<P>9. Now, O Light, do not leave me in the Chaos during the completion of my 
whole time. Do not abandon me, O Light. </P>
<P>10. For my whole light-power has been taken away from me. And all the 
emanations of the Authades have surrounded me. They wanted to take all my light 
from me completely, and they watched for my power. </P>
<P>11. They were saying at the same time to one another : the light has left her 
; let us seize her and take away all the light within her. 12. 
&lt;illegible&gt;. </P>
<P>13. May those who want to take away my power fall and become powerless. May 
those who want to take away my light-power from me be wrapped in darkness and 
exist in powerlessness. </P>
<P>This is the second repentance which the Pistis Sophia said, singing praises 
to the light." .</P>
<HR>

<P><STRONG>CHAPTER 36.</STRONG> </P>
<P>It happened now, when Jesus finished saying these words to his disciples, he 
said : "Do you understand in what manner I am speaking with you?" Peter leapt 
forward, he said to Jesus : "My Lord, we are not able to suffer this woman who 
takes the opportunity from us, and does not allow anyone of us to speak, but she 
speaks many times." Jesus answered, he said to his disciples : "Let him in whom 
the power of his Spirit has welled up so that he understands what I say, come 
forward and speak. Nevertheless, thou Peter, I see thy power within thee 
understands the interpretation of the mystery of the repentance which the Pistis 
Sophia spoke. Now at this time do thou, Peter, speak the thought of her 
repentance in the midst of thy brethren." Peter answered, however, he said to 
Jesus : "Lord, hear, so that I say the thought of her repentance, about which 
thy power once prophesied through David the prophet, saying her repentance in 
the 70th Psalm : </P>
<P>1. 'O God, my God, I have trusted in thee; let me never be put to shame. </P>
<P>2. Save me in thy righteousness and deliver me. Incline thy ear to me and 
save me. </P>
<P>3. Be to me a strong God and a fortified place to save me ; for thou art my 
strength and my place of refuge. </P>
<P>4. My God, save me from the hand of the sinner, and from the hand of the 
lawless and the impious. </P>
<P>5. For thou, O Lord, art my endurance; O Lord, thou art my hope from my 
youth. </P>
<P>6. I have relied upon thee from the womb; thou hast brought me forth from my 
mother's womb; my memory is of thee at all times. </P>
<P>7. I have become for many like the crazy; thou art my help and my strength, 
thou art my Saviour, O Lord. </P>
<P>8. My mouth has been filled with blessings, so that I might bless the glory 
of thy greatness all the day. </P>
<P>9. Cast me not out in the time of my old age; when my soul diminishes, do not 
forsake me. </P>
<P>10. For my enemies have spoken evil against me; and they who lie in wait for 
my soul have taken counsel against my soul. </P>
<P>11. Saying at the same time : God has forsaken him ; run and seize him, for 
there is none to save him. </P>
<P>12. O God, give heed to my help. </P>
<P>13. Let those that slander my soul be brought to shame and diminished; let 
those who seek evil against me be clothed with shame and disgrace.' This now is 
the interpretation of the second repentance which the Pistis Sophia said.".</P>
<HR>

<P><STRONG>CHAPTER 37.</STRONG> </P>
<P>The Saviour answered and said to Peter : " Well done, Peter, this is the 
interpretation of her repentance. You are blessed beyond all men upon earth, for 
I have revealed to you these mysteries. Truly, truly, I say to you : I will 
fulfill you in every pleroma, from the mysteries of the inner to the mysteries 
of the outer. And I will fill you with Spirit so that you are called Pneumatics, 
fulfilled in every pleroma. And truly, truly, I say to you that I will give you 
all the mysteries of all the places of my Father, and all the places of the 
First Mystery, so that he whom you receive on earth will be received into the 
light of the height. And he whom you cast out upon earth will be cast out of the 
Kingdom of my Father which is in heaven . Nevertheless now hear and give ear to 
all the repentances which the Pistis Sophia said. She continued again and spoke 
the third repentance, saying : </P>
<P>1. 'O Light of the powers, give heed and save me. </P>
<P>2. May those that want to take away my light from me fail and he in darkness. 
Let them return to the Chaos, and may those who want to take away my power be 
put to shame. </P>
<P>3. May those that persecute me and say : we have become lords over her, 
return quickly to the darkness. </P>
<P>4. May all those who seek after the light rejoice and flourish and may they 
who want thy mystery say at all times : let the mystery be raised up. </P>
<P>5. Do thou now at this time save me, O Light, for I am lacking in my light, 
which has been taken away. And I need my power which has been taken from me. 
Thou, O Light, thou art my Saviour, and thou art my rescuer, O Light. </P>
<P>Save me quickly out of this Chaos'." .</P>

<P><STRONG>CHAPTER 38.</STRONG> </P>
<P>It happened, however, when Jesus finished saying these words to his 
disciples, saying: "This is the third repentance which the Pistis Sophia said", 
he said to them : "Let him in whom the Spirit of perception has arisen, come 
forward and speak with understanding of the repentance which the Pistis Sophia 
said". </P>
<P>It happened now, before Jesus had finished speaking, Martha came forward, she 
prostrated herself at his feet, she kissed them. She cried out, she wept aloud 
in humility, saying: "My Lord, have mercy on me, and be compassionate towards 
me, and allow me to say the interpretation of the repentance which the Pistis 
Sophia said". And Jesus gave Martha his hand , he said to her : "Blessed is 
every man who humbles himself, for to him will mercy be given . Now at this 
time, Martha, thou art blessed. Never- ' give now the interpretation of the 
thought of the repentance of the Pistis Sophia". </P>
<P>Martha, however, answered and said to Jesus in the midst of the disciples : 
"Concerning the repentance which the Pistis Sophia said, O my Lord Jesus, thy 
light-power which was in David once prophesied in the 69th psalm, saying : </P>
<P>1. O Lord God, give heed to my help. </P>
<P>2. Let those that seek after my soul be put to shame and disgraced. </P>
<P>3. May those that say to me : excellent, excellent, be turned back 
immediately and put to shame. </P>
<P>4. May all those that seek after thee be glad and rejoice over thee; and may 
those that love thy salvation say at all times : let God be exalted. </P>
<P>5. But I am poor and I am needy. O Lord, help me ; thou art my help and my 
defense. O Lord, do not delay.' This now is the interpretation of the third 
repentance which the Pistis Sophia said, singing praises to the height.".</P>
<HR>

<P><STRONG>CHAPTER 39.</STRONG> </P>
<P>It happened now when Jesus heard Martha saying these words, he said : 
"Excellent, Martha, and well done." Jesus continued again with the discourse. He 
said to his disciples : "The Pistis Sophia continued again with the fourth 
repentance, saying it when the lion-faced power and all the material emanations 
with it, which the Authades had sent to the Chaos, had not yet afflicted her for 
the second time, to take away all the remaining light which was in her. She now 
said this repentance thus : </P>
<P>1. 'O Light whom I have trusted, hear my repentance; and let my voice come 
into thy dwelling-place. </P>
<P>2. Do not turn thy image of light away from me, but give heed to me. If they 
oppress me, save me quickly at the time when I cry to thee. </P>
<P>3. For my time has vanished like a breath, and I have become matter. </P>
<P>4. My light has been taken from me, and my power has dried up. I have 
forgotten my mystery which I performed at first. </P>
<P>5. Through the voice of fear and the power of the Authades, my power has 
diminished within me. </P>
<P>6. I have become like a peculiar demon, which dwells in matter, in whom is no 
light. And I have become like a spirit counterpart which is in a material body, 
in which there is no light-power. </P>
<P>7. And I have become like a decan, which is upon the air alone. </P>
<P>8. The emanations of the Authades have afflicted me greatly; and my partner 
has spoken of it thus : in place of the light within her, they have filled her 
with Chaos . </P>
<P>9. I have swallowed the sweat of my matter myself and the anguish of the 
tears of the matter of my eyes, lest those that oppress me take away these 
things also. </P>
<P>10. All these things have happened to me, O Light, through thy ordinance and 
with thy command. And it is thy ordinance that I should be among these things. 
</P>
<P>11. Thy ordinance has brought me down, and I have come down like a power of 
the Chaos.; and my power has congealed within me. </P>
<P>12. But thou, O Lord, art eternal light; and at all times thou dost seek 
those who are oppressed. </P>
<P>13. Now at this time, O Light, arise and seek after my power and my soul 
within me. Thy ordinance is completed, which thou hast ordained for me in my 
affliction. My time has come, that thou shouldst seek after my power and my 
soul, and this is the time which thou hast ordained to seek me ; 14. For thy 
saviours have sought after the power which is in my soul, because the number is 
completed, and that they should save its matter also. </P>
<P>15. And then in that time all the archon. of the material aeons will fear 
before thy light: and all the emanations of the thirteenth material aeon will 
fear before the mystery of thy light, that the others may put on themselves what 
is purified of their light. </P>
<P>16. For the Lord will seek after the power of your souls; he has revealed his 
mystery. </P>
<P>17. For he will look at the repentance of those who are in the places below; 
and he has not overlooked their repentance. </P>
<P>18. This is that mystery which has become a type for the race which will be 
born ; and the race which will be born will sing praises to the height. </P>
<P>19. For the light has looked forth from the height of his light. He will look 
down upon all matter ; 20. To hear the groaning of those that are bound; to 
release the power of the souls whose power is bound. </P>
<P>21. To place his name in the soul, and his mystery in the Power .</P>

Jesus said these words, John came forward. He kissed (lit. worshipped) the 
breast of Jesus, he said : "My Lord, command me also and allow, me that I speak 
the interpretation of the fourth repentance which the Pistis Sophia spoke". 
Jesus said to John: "I command thee and I allow thee to give (lit, say) the

<P>2. Turn not thy face away from me ; incline thy ear to me in the day of my

stone </P>
<P>4. I am scorched like grass and my heart is dried up ; for I have forgotten 
to eat my bread </P>
<P>5. From the voice of my groaning my bone has cleaved to my flesh </P>

<P>7. I have spent nights of vigil; I have become like a sparrow alone upon a

<P>8. My enemies have reproached me all day long ; and those that honour me have 
sworn against me. 9. For I have eaten ashes in place of my bread; I have mixed 
my drink with tears; 10. In the presence of thy wrath and thy anger; for thou 
hast lifted me up, thou hast cast me down </P>
<P>11. My days have declined like a shadow, and I am dried up like grass- l2. 
But thou, O Lord, dost exist for ever ; and thy memory from generation to 
generation. </P>
<P>13. Do thou arise and be compassionate to Zion; for it is (lit. has happened)

<P>14. Thy servants have desired her stones; and they will show pity on her land 
</P>
<P>15. The peoples will fear the name of the Lord and the kings of the earth 
will fear thy glory </P>
<P>16. For the Lord will build Zion and be manifest in his glory' 17. He has 
looked upon the prayer of the humble, and he has not despised their petition 
</P>
<P>18. Let this be written for another generation; and the people which will be 
created will bless the Lord </P>
<P>19. Because he has looked forth upon his holy height; the Lord has looked 
forth from heaven upon the earth; 20. To hear the groaning of those that are 
bound, to release the sons of those who have been killed; 21. To speak the name 
of the Lord in Zion, and his blessing in Jerusalem </P>
<P>This, my Lord, is the interpretation of the mystery of the repentance which 
the Pistis Sophia spoke." .</P>

<P><STRONG>CHAPTER 41.</STRONG> </P>
<P>Now it happened when John finished saying these words to Jesus in the midst 
of his disciples, he said to him : "Excellent, John, thou virgin who wilt rule 
in the Kingdom of the Light," Jesus, however, continued again with the 
discourse, he said to his disciples : "it happened again thus : the emanations 
of the Authades oppressed the Pistis Sophia in the Chaos (es). </P>
<P>They wanted to take away all her light, and the ordinance was not yet 
completed to bring her forth from the Chaos, and the command had not yet come to 
me through the First Mystery to save her from the Chaos. Now it happened, when 
all the material emanations of the Authades oppressed her, she cried out and 
spoke the fifth repentance, saying : </P>
<P>1. 'O Light of my salvation, I sing praise to thee in the place of the 
height, and again in the Chaos. </P>
<P>2. I will sing praise to thee in my song, with which I have praised thee in 
the height, and with which I have praised thee when I was in the Chaos; may it 
reach thee. And give heed, O Light, to my repentance. </P>
<P>3. My power has been filled with darkness; and my light has come down to the 
Chaos. 4. I have become like the archons of the Chaos which have gone to the 
darkness below; I have become like a material body, which has no one in the 
height who will save it. </P>
<P>5. I have become like material things whose power has been taken from them as 
they were cast into the Chaos, which thou hast not saved; and they have been 
destroyed by thy ordinance. </P>
<P>6. Now at this time I have been placed in the darkness below, in dark things 
and in material things which are dead ; and there is no power within them. </P>
<P>7. Thou hast brought thy ordinance upon me ; with all things which thou hast 
ordained. </P>
<P>8. And the Spirit has departed and left me; and again, through thy ordinance, 
the emanations of my aeon have not helped me ; and they have hated me and they 
have ceased towards me, and yet I am not completely destroyed. </P>
<P>9. And my light has diminished within me, and I have cried out to the light 
with all the light that is in me ; and I have stretched out my hands to thee. 
</P>
<P>10. Now at this time, O Light, wilt thou perhaps fulfill thy ordinance in the 
Chaos? And will the saviours, perhaps, who came according to thy ordinance, 
arise in the darkness and come and be disciples to thee? 11. Will they, perhaps, 
say the mystery of thy name in the Chaos? 12. Or will they not rather say thy 
name in matter of the Chaos, this in which thou wilt not purify? 13. But I have 
sung praises to thee, O Light, and my repentance will reach thee in the height. 
</P>
<P>14. May thy light come down upon me. </P>
<P>15. My light has been taken from me and I am in distress on account of the 
light, from the time when I was emanated forth. And when I looked to the height 
to the light, I looked down to the light-power which is in the Chaos ; I rose, I 
came down. </P>
<P>16. Thy ordinance came down upon me, and the fears which thou didst ordain 
for me, agitated me. </P>
<P>17. And they surrounded me roaring like water, they seized me at once for all 
my time. </P>
<P>18. And through thy ordinance, thou didst not allow my fellow-emanations to 
help me ; and thou didst not allow my partner to save me from my afflictions.' 
This now is the fifth repentance which the Pistis Sophia said in the Chaos, when 
all the material emanations of the Authades continued to afflict her.".</P>
<HR>

<P><STRONG>CHAPTER 42.</STRONG> </P>
<P>Now when Jesus said these things to his disciples, he said to them: "He who 
has ears to hear, let him the things which I will do, and the things which you 
will see. </P>
<P>And you will bear witness to all things of the Kingdom of Heaven.". </P>
<HR>

<P><STRONG>CHAPTER 43.</STRONG> </P>
<P>Now when Jesus said these things he said to his disciples : "He who has ears 
to hear, let him hear." Mariam sprang up again, she came to the midst, she stood 
beside Philip, she said to Jesus : "My Lord, my man of light has ears, and I am 
prepared to hear by means of my power. And I have understood the word which thou 
hast spoken. Now at this time, my Lord, hear, so that I speak openly, for thou 
hast said to us : 'He who has ears to hear, let him hear.' Concerning the word 
which thou didst say to Philip: 'Thou and Thomas and Matthew are the three to 
whom it has been given, through the First Mystery, to write every word of the 
Kingdom of the Light, and to bear witness to them'; hear now that I give the 
interpretation of these words. It is this which thy light-power once prophesied 
through Moses: 'Through two and three witnesses everything will be established. 
The three witnesses are Philip and Thomas and Matthew". </P>
<P>Now it happened when Jesus heard these words, he said : Excellent, Maria, 
this is the interpretation of the word. </P>
<P>Now at this time, do thou, Philip, come forward and give the interpretation 
of the mystery of the fifth repentance of the Pistis Sophia. And afterwards sit 
and write every word which I shall speak until the completion of the number of 
thy part in the words of the Kingdom of the Light, which thou wilt write. After 
this thou shalt come forward and speak whatever thy Spirit shall understand. 
Nevertheless now, at this time give the explanation of the mystery of the fifth 
repentance of the Pistis Sophia. </P>
<P>But Philip answered and said to Jesus : "My Lord, hear that I say the 
interpretation of her repentance. For thy power once prophesied about it through 
David in the 87th Psalm, saying : </P>
<P>1. 'O Lord God of my salvation, I have cried to thee by day and night. </P>
<P>2. Let my prayer come before thy presence. Incline thy ear, O Lord, to my 
petition. </P>
<P>3. For my soul is filled with evil ; my life has approached Amente . </P>
<P>4. I am numbered with those who have gone down to the pit, I have become like 
a man without a helper. </P>
<P>5. The free among the dead are like the slain who are cast out and sleep in 
graves, whom now thou dost not remember; and they are destroyed through thy 
hands. </P>
<P>6. I have been laid in a pit below in darknesses and the shadow of death. 7. 
Thy anger has pressed down upon me ; and all thy cares have come down upon me. 
Pause. </P>
<P>8. Thou hast caused those that know me to be distant from me ; they have set 
me as an abomination to themselves ; they have set me and I did not go. </P>
<P>9. My eye(s) became weak through my poverty; I cried to thee, O Lord, all the 
day; I spread out my hands to thee. </P>
<P>10. Wilt thou perhaps do thy wonders among the dead? Will shades 1 rise that 
they confess thee? 11. Will thy name perhaps be spoken in the graves? 12. And 
thy righteousness in a land which thou hast forgotten? 13. But I have cried to 
thee, O Lord, and my prayer will reach thee at the hour of daybreak. </P>
<P>14. Turn not thy face away from me. </P>
<P>15. For I am poor; I have been in distress since my youth ; but when I was 
exalted I humbled myself, and I arose. </P>
<P>16. Thy rages have come down upon me, and thy fears have agitated me. </P>
<P>17. They have surrounded me like water; they have seized me all day. </P>
<P>18. Thou hast caused my companions to be distant from me; and those that know 
me on account of my wretchedness'*. </P>
<P>This now is the interpretation of the fifth repentance which the Pistis 
Sophia said when she was afflicted in the Chaos. .</P>
<HR>

<P><STRONG>CHAPTER 44.</STRONG> </P>
<P>It happened now when Jesus heard these words which Philip said , he said to 
him : " Excellent, Philip, thou beloved one. Come now at this time, sit and 
write thy part of every word which I shall say, and what I shall do, and 
everything which thou shalt see". And immediately Philip sat down and wrote. 
</P>
<P>It happened furthermore after this Jesus continued again with the discourse. 
He said to his disciples : " Then the Pistis Sophia cried out to the Light. He 
forgave her sin, that she had forsaken her place, she had come down to the 
darkness. </P>
<P>She spoke the sixth repentance in this way, saying : 1. I have sung praises 
to thee, O Light, in the darkness below. </P>
<P>2.Hear my repentance, and may thy light give heed to the voice of my 
entreaty. </P>
<P>3. O Light, if thou dost remember my sins I shall not be able to come before 
thee, and thou wilt forsake me. </P>
<P>4. For thou, O Light, art my Saviour on account of the light of thy name. I 
have believed in thee, O Light. </P>
<P>5. And my power believed in thy mystery. And furthermore, my power trusted in 
the light, when it was in those of the height, and it (my power) trusted it (the 
light) when it (my power) was in the Chaos below. </P>
<P>6. May all the powers within me trust the light, when I am in the darkness 
below, and may they trust it when they come to the place of the height. 7. For 
it (the light) is merciful to us and saves us, and there is a great mystery of 
salvation within it. </P>
<P>8. And it will save all the powers from the Chaos on account of my 
transgression, because I have forsaken my place, I have come down to the Chaos.' 
At this time now, he whose understanding (mind) is uplifted , let him 
understand.".</P>

<P>Now it happened when Jesus finished saying these words to his disciples, he

until evening. 7. For mercy is in the hand of the Lord, and with him is a great 
salvation. </P>
<P>8. And he will save Israel out of all his iniquities ". </P>
<P>Jesus said to him : "Excellent, Andrew, thou blessed one. </P>
<P>This is the interpretation of her repentance. Truly, truly, I say to you, I 
will fulfill you in all the mysteries of the light, and every gnosis, from the 
innermost of the inner to the outermost of the outer; from the Ineffable to the 
darkness of darknesses ; and from the Light of Lights to the (? matter) of 
matter ; from all the gods to the demons ; from all the lords to the decans; 
from all the powers (exousiai) to the ministers ; from the creation of men to 
(that off beasts and cattle and reptiles, in order that you be called perfect, 
fulfilled in every pleroma. Truly, truly, I say to you that, in the place in 
which I shall be in the Kingdom of my Father, you will also be there with me . 
And when the perfect number is completed so that the mixture is dissolved, I 
will command that all the tyrant gods who did not give (up) what is purified of 
their light be brought. I will command the fire of wisdom, which the perfect 
ones transmit, to consume those tyrants until they give (up) the last of what is 
purified of their light." It happened, when Jesus finished saying these words to 
his disciples, he said to them : "Do you understand in what manner I have spoken 
to you?" Maria said : "Yes, O Lord, I have understood the discourse which thou 
hast spoken. Concerning the word now which thou didst say : 'At the dissolving 
of the whole mixture thou wilt sit upon a light-power, and thy disciples, that 
is we, we will sit to the right of thee . And thou wilt judge the tyrant gods 
which did not give (up) what is purified of their light. And the fire of wisdom 
will consume them until they give (up) the last of the light which is in them.' 
Now concerning this word, thy light-power once prophesied, through David, in the 
81st Psalm, saying : 'God will sit in the assembly of gods and will judge the 
gods ". </P>
<P>Jesus said to her : "Excellent, Maria.".</P>
<HR>

<P><STRONG>CHAPTER 46</STRONG>. </P>
<P>Jesus continued again with the discourse, he said to his disciples : "It 
happened when the Pistis Sophia finished saying the sixth repentance concerning 
the forgiveness of her transgression, she turned again to the height to see 
whether her sins were forgiven her, and to see whether she would be brought up 
from the Chaos. And she was not yet heard, through the command of the First 
Mystery, that her sin would be forgiven, and that she would be brought out of 
the Chaos. ( When she turned to the height to see whether her repentance was 
accepted, she saw all the archons of the twelve aeons mocking her and rejoicing 
over her, because her repentance was not yet accepted. When she now saw them 
mocking her, she was very sorrowful, she lifted up her voice to the height, 
saying in the seventh repentance : </P>
<P>1. 'O Light, I have raised up my power to thee, my Light. </P>
<P>2. I have believed in thee ; do not make me to be despised. </P>
<P>Do not make the archons of the twelve aeons, which hate me, rejoice over me. 
</P>
<P>3. For all those that believe in thee will not be brought to shame. May those 
who have taken away my power remain in darkness, and have no profit from it, but 
have it taken away from them. </P>
<P>4. O Light, show me thy ways, and I will be saved by them ; and show me thy 
paths, so that I be saved in the Chaos. </P>
<P>5. And lead me in thy light, and may I know, O Light, that thou art my 
Saviour; I will trust thee in my whole time. </P>
<P>6. Give heed, so that thou savest me, O Light, because thy compassion exists 
for ever. </P>
<P>7. Concerning my transgression which I have committed from the beginning in 
my ignorance, do not count it against me, O Light, but rather save me through 
thy great mystery of forgiveness of sins, for the sake of thy goodness, O Light. 
8. For the Light is good and upright. Because of this he (the Light) will allow 
me (lit. give me my way) to be saved from my transgression. </P>
<P>9. And my powers, which are diminished through fear of the material 
emanations of the Authades, he will draw out thence by his ordinance. And to my 
powers, which are diminished through lack of mercy, he will teach his knowledge. 
</P>
<P>10. For all knowledges of the light are salvations and are mysteries to 
everyone who seeks the places of his inheritance and his mysteries. </P>
<P>11. For the sake of the mystery of thy name, O Light, forgive my 
transgression, for it is great. </P>
<P>12. To everyone who trusts the light, he will give the mystery which pleases 
him. </P>
<P>13. And his soul will exist in the places of the light; and his power will 
inherit the Treasury of the Light. </P>
<P>14. It is the light which gives power to those that believe in it. And the 
name of its mystery is for those that trust it. </P>
<P>And it will show them the place of the inheritance which is in the Treasury 
of the Light. </P>
<P>15. Moreover I have believed in the light at all times, that it is this which 
will save my feet from the bonds of the darkness. 16.Give heed to me, o Light, 
and save me, for my name has been taken from me in the Chaos. </P>
<P>17. Beyond all the emanations, my questions and my oppressions are very 
numerous; save me from my transgression and this darkness. </P>
<P>18. And look upon the distress of my oppression and forgive my transgression. 
</P>
<P>19. Give heed to the archons of the twelve aeons which hate me with envy. 
</P>
<P>20. Watch over my power and save me ; and let me not remain in this darkness, 
for I have believed in thee. </P>
<P>21. And they have committed a great folly for I have believed in thee, O 
Light. </P>
<P>22. Now at this time, O Light, save my powers from the emanations of the 
Authades, by which I am oppressed.' Now at this time, he who is sober, let him 
be sober." Now when Jesus had said these things to his disciples, Thomas came 
forward, he said: "My Lord, I am sober, I have become more sober, and my Spirit 
is ready within me. And I rejoice greatly because thou hast revealed to us these 
words. Nevertheless I have suffered my brothers up till now lest I cause anger 
in them. But I suffer each one of them to come before thee to say the 
interpretation of the repentance of the Pistis Sophia. Now at this time, O Lord, 
concerning the interpretation of the seventh repentance of the Pistis Sophia, 
thy light-power prophesied about it, through David the prophet, saying it thus 
in the 24th Psalm : 1. O Lord, I have lifted up my soul to thee, my God. </P>
<P>2. I have relied on thee; let me not be put to shame, nor let my enemies mock 
at me. </P>
<P>3. Because everyone that waits upon thee will not be put to shame. Let those 
that commit iniquity without cause be ashamed. </P>
<P>4. O Lord, show me thy ways, and teach me thy paths. </P>
<P>5. Lead me in the way of thy truth, and teach me for thou art my God, my 
Saviour. I will wait on thee the whole day. </P>
<P>6. Remember thy compassion, O Lord, and thy mercies, for they are from 
eternity. </P>
<P>7. Remember not the sins of my youth and those of my ignorance. Remember me 
rather according to the greatness of thy mercy, for the sake of thy beneficence, 
O Lord. </P>
<P>8. Beneficent and upright is the Lord; because of this, he will teach the 
sinners on the way. </P>
<P>9. He will guide the compassionate in judgment; he will teach the 
compassionate his ways. </P>
<P>10. All the ways of the Lord are mercy and truth for those that seek his 
righteousness and his witness. </P>
<P>11. For thy name's sake, O Lord, forgive me my sin, (for) it is very great. 
</P>
<P>12. Who is the man who fears the Lord? He will appoint (the) law for him in 
the way which he has chosen. </P>
<P>13. His soul will be in good things; and his seed will inherit the earth. 14. 
The Lord is the strength of those that fear him ; and the name of the Lord, to 
those that fear him, is that which tells them of his covenant. </P>
<P>15. My eyes are directed to the Lord at all times; for it is he who will draw 
my feet out of the snare. </P>
<P>16. Look down upon me and have mercy on me ; for I am an only son , l am 
poor. </P>
<P>17. The afflictions of my heart have multiplied; lead me forth from my 
necessities. </P>
<P>18. Look upon my humbleness and my distress, and forgive all my sins. </P>
<P>19. Look upon my enemies, for they have multiplied and they have hated me 
with an unjust hatred. </P>
<P>20. Guard my soul and save me ; let me not be put to shame for I have hoped 
in thee. </P>
<P>21. The harmless and the upright have joined themselves to me ; for I have 
waited upon thee, O Lord. </P>
<P>22. O God, save Israel from all his afflictions' ". </P>
<P>When however Jesus heard the words of Thomas, he said to him : "Excellent, 
Thomas, and well done. This is the interpretation of the seventh repentance of 
the Pistis Sophia. </P>
<P>Truly, truly, I say to you that all the generations of the world will bless 
you upon the earth, because I have revealed this to you, and you have received 
of my Spirit, and you have become understanding and Pneumatic, since you have 
understood what I have said. And after this I will fill you with all the light 
and all the power of the Spirit, so that from this time you will understand all 
those things which will be said to you, and those things which you will see. Yet 
a little time and I will speak with you of all the things of the height, from 
the outer to the inner, and from the inner to the outer.".</P>
<HR>

<P><STRONG>CHAPTER 47</STRONG> Jesus continued again with the discourse, he said 
to the disciples : "Now it happened when the Pistis Sophia said her seventh 
repentance in the Chaos, the command, through the First Mystery, that I should 
save her and bring her up from the Chaos, had not yet come forth to me. </P>
<P>But I of myself, out of compassion, without command, I brought her to a place 
in the Chaos which was a little wider. </P>
<P>And when the material emanations of the Authades knew she had been brought to 
a place in the Chaos which was a little wider, they ceased a little from 
oppressing her, thinking she would be brought up from the Chaos completely. Now 
when these things happened, the Pistis Sophia did not know that it was I who 
helped her, nor did she know me at all. </P>
<P>But she continued singing praises to the light of the Treasury which she had 
once seen, and in which she believed. And she thought, furthermore, that it was 
he who helped her. And it was he to whom she sang praises, thinking that he was 
the true light. But since she believed in the light which belongs to the true 
Treasury, for this reason she will be brought up from the Chaos and her 
repentance will be received. But the ordinance of the First Mystery that her 
repentance should be received was not yet completed. Therefore hear now, and I 
will tell you all the things (lit. words) which happened to the Pistis Sophia. 
</P>
<P>It happened when I brought her to a place in the Chaos, which was a little 
wider, the emanations of the Authades ceased from oppressing her greatly , 
thinking she would be brought up from the Chaos completely. Now it happened when 
the emanations of the Authades knew that the Pistis Sophia was not brought up 
from the Chaos, they turned again at the same time to oppress her greatly. 
Because of this she now said the eighth repentance, because they had ceased from 
oppressing her, and they had turned again to oppress her to the last. She spoke 
this repentance, saying it thus : </P>
<P>1. 'I have hoped in thee, O Light. Leave me not in the Chaos; save me and 
deliver me with thy knowledge. </P>
<P>2. Give heed to me and save me. Be to me a Saviour, O Light, and save me and 
bring me into the presence of thy light. </P>
<P>3. For thou art my Saviour and thou wilt bring me to thy presence. And for 
the sake of the mystery of thy name, lead me and give me thy mystery. 4. And 
thou wilt save me as I am ensnared by this lion-faced power; for thou art my 
Saviour. </P>
<P>5. And I will give what is purified of my light into thy hands; thou hast 
saved me, O Light, with thy knowledge. </P>
<P>6. Thou hast been angry with those who watch for me, who will not be able to 
seize me at all. But I have believed in the light. </P>
<P>7. I will rejoice and sing praises, for thou hast had compassion on me ; and 
thou hast given heed to the oppression in which I am. And thou hast saved me. 
And also thou wilt deliver my power from the Chaos. </P>
<P>8. And thou didst not leave me to be in the hands of the lion-faced power, 
but thou hast brought me to a place which is not oppressed'.". </P>
<HR>

<P><STRONG>CHAPTER 48</STRONG>. </P>
<P>When Jesus had said these things to his disciples, he answered again and said 
to them : "It happened now when the lion-faced power knew that the Pistis Sophia 
was not brought up from the Chaos at all, it came again with all the rest of the 
material/ emanations of the Authades. They oppressed the Pistis Sophia again. 
Now it happened when they oppressed her, she cried out in this same repentance, 
in which she spoke thus: 9. Have compassion on me, O Light, for they have 
oppressed me again. The light within me has been agitated on account of thy 
ordinance; and my power and my understanding (mind). </P>
<P>10. My power has begun to decrease while I am in these oppressions; and the 
reckoning of my time while I am in the Chaos. My light has diminished, for they 
have taken away my power from me, and all the powers within me have been shaken. 
</P>
<P>11. I have become powerless before 1 all the archons of the aeons which hate 
me, and before the 24 emanations in whose places I was. And my brother, my 
partner, feared to help me, on account of those among whom I was held. </P>
<P>12. And all the archons of the height have reckoned me to be matter without 
light in it. I have become like a material power which has fallen out of the 
archons. </P>
<P>13. And all those who were in the aeons said : she has become Chaos. And 
after this the merciless powers surrounded me at the same time, and spoke to 
take away all my light that was in me. </P>
<P>14. But I trusted thee, O Light, and I said : thou art my Saviour. </P>
<P>15. And my ordinance which thou hast ordained for me is in thy hands; save me 
from the hands of the emanations of the Authades which oppress me and pursue 
after me. </P>
<P>16. Send down thy light upon me, for I am nothing before thee; and save me in 
thy compassion. </P>
<P>17. Let me not be despised, for thou art he to whom I have sung praises, O 
Light. May the Chaos cover over the emanations of the Authades, and may they be 
cast down to the darkness. 18. May the mouth be shut of those who, with cunning, 
want to swallow me ; who say : let us take away all the light within her, 
although I have done nothing wicked to them'." .</P>

<P><STRONG>CHAPTER 49.</STRONG> </P>
<P>When, however, Jesus had said these things, Matthew came forward and said : 
"My Lord, thy Spirit has moved me, and thy light has made me sober, so that I 
should tell the eighth repentance of the Pistis Sophia. For thy power once 
prophesied about it through David, in the 30th Psalm, saying : </P>
<P>1. 'I have hoped in thee, O Lord. Let me not be put to shame for ever; save 
me in thy righteousness. </P>
<P>2. Incline thine ear to me; save me quickly, be to me a protecting God and a 
house of refuge to save me. </P>
<P>3. For thou art my support and my refuge; for the sake of thy name thou wilt 
guide me and nourish me. </P>
<P>4. And thou wilt bring me forth from this snare which they have hidden for 
me, for thou art my protector. </P>
<P>5. I will give up my spirit into thy hands. Thou hast saved me, O Lord, God 
of truth. </P>
<P>6. Thou hast hated those who idly keep to what is vain. </P>
<P>But I have trusted; 7. And I will rejoice over the Lord , and I will be glad 
over thy mercy; for thou hast looked upon my humbleness, and thou hast saved my 
soul out of my necessities. </P>
<P>8. Thou hast not shut me in the hands of the enemy ; thou hast set my feet in 
a wide place. </P>
<P>9. Have mercy on me, O Lord, for I am afflicted; my eye is I troubled with 
anger; and my soul and my belly. </P>
<P>10. For my years have been spent in distress and my life has been spent in 
groanings; my power has become weak in poverty, and my bones are troubled. </P>
<P>11. I have become a reproach to all my enemies and my neighbors. I have 
become a fear to those that know me, and those that saw me ran away from me. 
</P>
<P>12. I have been forgotten like a corpse in their hearts; and I have become 
like a broken vessel. </P>
<P>13. I have heard contempt from many at my side who surrounded me ; when they 
gathered together against me, they took counsel to take away my soul from me. 
</P>
<P>14. But I have trusted thee, O Lord, I have said : thou art my God. </P>
<P>15. My lots are in thy hands; save me from the hand of my enemies, and 
deliver me from those that persecute me. </P>
<P>16. Reveal thy face over thy servant, and save me in thy mercy, O Lord. </P>
<P>17. Let me not be put to shame, for I have cried to thee; let the impious be 
put to shame and turned to Amente. </P>
<P>18. Let the cunning lips be dumb, who speak iniquity against the righteous 
with pride and contempt'.".</P>

<P><STRONG>CHAPTER 50.</STRONG> </P>
<P>When however Jesus heard these words, he said: "Well done, Matthew. Now at 
this time truly I say to you, when the perfect number is completed and the All 
is raised up, I will sit in the Treasury of the Light, and you yourselves will 
sit on twelve light-powers, until we have set up again all the ranks of the 
twelve saviors at the place of the inheritance of each one of them." But when he 
had said these things, he said : "Do you understand what I say?" Maria came 
forward and said : "O Lord, concerning this, thou didst once say to us in a 
parable: 'You have endured with me in temptations. I will establish a kingdom 
for you in the way in which my Father established it for me , so that you may 
eat and drink at my table in my kingdom. And you will sit upon twelve thrones 
and judge the twelve tribes of Israel'." He said to her : "Excellent, Maria." 
Jesus continued again and said to his disciples : "Now it happened after these 
things, when the emanations of the Authades oppressed the Pistis Sophia in the 
Chaos, she spoke the ninth repentance, saying : </P>
<P>1. 'O Light, smite down those who have taken my power away from me ; and take 
the power from those who have taken mine from me. </P>
<P>2. For I am thy power and thy light ; come and save me. 3. May a great 
darkness cover over those that oppress me ; say to my power : it is I who will 
save thee. </P>
<P>4. All those who want to take my light from me completely : may their power 
fail; those who want to take my light from me completely : may they turn to the 
Chaos and become powerless. </P>
<P>5. May their power become like dust; and may Jeu, thine angel, smite them 
down. </P>
<P>6. And if they come to go to the height, may a darkness seize them, so that 
they stumble and turn to the Chaos; and may thine angel, Jeu, pursue them and 
send them to the darkness below. </P>
<P>7. For without my having done evil to them, they have ensnared me with a 
lion-faced power from which their light will be taken; they have oppressed the 
power within me, which they will not able to take away. </P>
<P>8. Now at this time, O Light, take away what is purified from the lion-faced 
power, without his knowing; and the thought which the Authades had (lit. 
thought), to take away my light : take his own away; and let the light of the 
lion-faced power, which ensnared me, be taken away. </P>
<P>9. My power will flourish in the light and will rejoice because it will save 
it. </P>
<P>10. And all the parts of my power will say : there is now no Saviour except 
thee; for it is thou who wilt save me from the hands of the lion-faced power 
which has taken my power from me. And it is thou who savest me from the hands of 
those who have taken my power and my light from me. </P>
<P>11. For they stood up against me and told lies about me. </P>
<P>And they say : I know the mystery of the light which is in the height, in 
which I have believed. And they have compelled me, saying : Tell us the mystery 
of the light which is in the height, this one which I do not know. </P>
<P>12. And they have repaid me with all these wicked things, because I have 
believed in the light of the height; and they have made my power to be without 
light. </P>
<P>13. But when I was compelled, I sat in the darkness, while my soul was humble 
in sorrow. </P>
<P>14. And, O Light, concerning whom I sing praises to thee, save me ; I know 
that thou wilt save me, because I have done thy will since I was in my aeon. I 
have done thy will like the invisible ones who are in my place, and like my 
partner; and I became sorrowful as I looked, seeking for thy light. </P>
<P>15. Now at this time all the emanations of the Authades have surrounded me ; 
and have rejoiced over me, and they have oppressed me greatly, without my 
knowing; and they have run away, they have left me, and they have not been 
merciful to me. </P>
<P>16. They turned again and tempted me, and they oppressed me with great 
oppression; they gnashed their teeth at me, wanting to take away my light from 
me completely. </P>
<P>17. How long now, O Light, dost thou suffer them, that they oppress me ? Save 
my power from their wicked thoughts, and save me from the lion-faced power, for 
I alone among the invisible ones am in this place. </P>
<P>18. I will sing praise to thee, O Light, while I am in the midst of all those 
gathered against me. And I will cry out to thee in the midst of all those that 
oppress me. </P>
<P>19. Now at this time, O Light, let not those that hate me and want to take 
away my power from me, rejoice over me; these who hate me, as they move their 
eyes against me, without my having done anything to them. </P>
<P>20. For indeed they flatter me with sweet words while they seek from me the 
mysteries of the light which I do not know; speaking to me with cunning against 
me, and raging against me, because I have believed in the light which is in the 
height. </P>
<P>21. They have opened their mouths against me ; they have said : Yes. We will 
take away her light. </P>
<P>22. Now at this time, O Light, thou hast known their cunning ; suffer them 
not, and let not thy help be far from me. </P>
<P>23. Make haste, O Light, judge me and avenge me. 24. And give judgment to me 
in thy goodness; now at this time, O Light of Lights, let them not take my light 
from me. </P>
<P>25. And do not let them say in their hearts : Our power has satisfied itself 
with her light; and let them not say : We have swallowed her power. </P>
<P>26. But rather let darkness come down upon them; and let those that want to 
take away my light from me become powerless; and those that say : We will take 
away her light and her power, let them be covered with Chaos and darkness, 27. 
Now at this time, save me, that I may rejoice, because I want the thirteenth 
aeon, the place of righteousness. And I will say at all times : May the light of 
Jeu, thy angel, give more light. </P>
<P>28. And my tongue will sing praises to thee in thy knowledge, all my time in 
the thirteenth aeon'.".</P>

<P>It happened when Jesus finished saying these words to his disciples, he said 
to them : "He who is sober among you, let him give their interpretation." James 
came forward, he kissed the breast of Jesus and said : "My Lord, thy Spirit has 
made me sober , and I am willing to give their interpretation. Concerning this, 
indeed, thy power prophesied once, through David, in the 34th Psalm, speaking 
thus about the ninth repentance of the Pistis Sophia : </P>
<P>1. 'Judge, O Lord, those who do injustice to me; fight with those who fight 
with me. 2. Take hold of a weapon and shield, and rise to help me. </P>
<P>3. Draw forth a sword and unsheathe it in the presence of those that afflict 
me ; say to my soul : I am thy salvation. </P>
<P>4. May they be put to shame and disgrace that seek my soul; may those that 
think wicked things about me be turned back and be put to shame. </P>
<P>5. May they become like dust before the wind; and may the angel of the Lord 
pursue them. </P>
<P>6. May their paths become dark and slippery; and may the angel of the Lord 
afflict them. </P>
<P>7. For, without cause, they have hidden for me a snare to their own 
destruction; and in vain they have slandered my soul. </P>
<P>8. May the snare which they do not know come to them; and may the net, which 
they have hidden for me, catch them, and may they fall into this snare. </P>
<P>9. But my soul will rejoice over the Lord, and be glad over its salvation. 
</P>
<P>10. All my bones will say : O Lord, who can resemble thee? Thou dost save the 
poor out of the hand of those that are stronger than he ; and thou dost save a 
poor man and a needy from the hands of those that rob him. </P>
<P>11. Unjust witnesses have arisen; they have questioned me about things which 
I do not know. 12. They repaid me evil things for good, and childlessness to my 
soul. </P>
<P>13. But I, when they troubled me, I put on sackcloth, and I humbled my soul 
with fasting; and my prayer will return again to my bosom. </P>
<P>14. I was agreeable as if to my neighbor, and as if to my brother ; and I 
humbled myself like a mourner and a sorrowful one. </P>
<P>15. They have rejoiced over me and have been put to shame. Scourges were 
gathered against me and I did not know; they were separated and they were not 
distressed. </P>
<P>16. They tempted me, and they sneered at me contemptuously; they gnashed 
their teeth against me. </P>
<P>17. O Lord, when wilt thou look down upon me ? Establish my soul away from 
their wicked deeds; and save my only-begotten one from the lions. </P>
<P>18. I will confess thee, O Lord, in a great congregation, and I will bless 
thee among countless people. </P>
<P>19. Let not those who are enemies to me unjustly, who hate me without cause 
and wink with their eyes, rejoice over me. </P>
<P>20. For indeed they speak to me with peaceful words ; and they imagine wrath 
with cunning. 21. They opened wide their mouths against me and they said : 
Excellent, our eyes have had a full view of him. </P>
<P>22. Thou hast seen, O Lord, be not silent, O Lord; draw not back from me. 
</P>
<P>23. Arise, O Lord, give heed to my judgment; give heed to my revenge, my God 
and my Lord. </P>
<P>24. Judge me, O Lord, according to my righteousness; let them not rejoice 
over me, my God. </P>
<P>25. Neither let them say : Excellent, our soul; let them not say : We have 
swallowed him. </P>
<P>26. Let those that rejoice over my misfortunes be put to shame, and disgraced 
at the same time; let those that speak great words against me be covered with 
shame and disgrace. </P>
<P>27. Let those that wish my righteousness be glad and rejoice; and may those 
that wish the peace of his servant say : let the Lord be magnified and lifted 
up. </P>
<P>28. My tongue will rejoice at thy righteousness and thy glory all the 
day'.".</P>

<P><STRONG>CHAPTER 52.</STRONG> </P>
<P>When James had said these things, Jesus said : Excellent, well done, James. 
This is the interpretation of the ninth repentance of the Pistis Sophia. Truly, 
truly, I say to you that you will become first in the Kingdom of Heaven, before 
all the invisible ones, and all the gods, and all the archons, which are in the 
thirteenth aeon, and in the twelfth aeon. But not only you, but also everyone 
who will perform my mysteries." When he had said these things, he said to them : 
"Do you understand in what manner I am speaking with you ?" Mariam sprang up 
again, she said : "Yes, O Lord. This is what thou didst say to us once : 'The 
last will become first and the first will become last.' Now the first, which 
were created before us, are the invisible ones, since they existed before 
mankind, they and the gods and the archons; and the men who will receive 
mysteries will precede them in the Kingdom of Heaven." Jesus said to her : 
"Excellent, Mariam." Jesus continued again, he said to his disciples: "Now it 
happened when the Pistis Sophia had said the ninth repentance, the lion-faced 
power oppressed her again, wanting to take away all the power within her. She 
cried again to the Light, saying : 'O Light, in whom I have believed from the 
beginning, for whose sake I have suffered great afflictions, help me.' And in 
that hour her repentance was accepted. The First Mystery heard her. And I was 
sent at his command, I came to help her, I brought her up from the Chaos because 
she had repented, and also because she had believed in the light, and she had 
suffered these great afflictions and these great dangers. She was deceived by 
the deity Authades. And she was deceived by nothing except a light-power, 
because of the likeness of the light in which she believed. Now because of this 
I was sent, through the command of the First Mystery to help her secretly. But I 
had not yet come to the place of the aeons at all. But I came forth from the 
midst of them all without any power knowing; neither the innermost ones of the 
inner, nor the outermost ones of the outer, except for the First Mystery alone. 
</P>
<P>Now it happened when I came to the Chaos, to help her, she saw that I was 
understanding, and that I was shining exceedingly and with compassion towards 
her. For I was not insolent like the lion-faced power, which had taken away the 
power of light from the Sophia, and which had also afflicted her, to take away 
all the light within her. Now the Sophia saw me, that I was shining ten thousand 
times more than the lion-faced power, and that I had great compassion towards 
her. And she knew that I was from out of the height of heights, in the light of 
which she had believed from the beginning. The Pistis Sophia took courage and 
she spoke the tenth repentance, saying : </P>
<P>1. 'I have cried out to thee, O Light of Lights, in my affliction, and thou 
hast heard me. </P>
<P>2. O Light, save my power from unjust and iniquitous lips, and from cunning 
snares. 3. The light which was taken away from me with a cunning snare will not 
be brought to thee. </P>
<P>4. For the snares of the Authades are widespread, with the traps of the 
merciless. </P>
<P>5. Woe to me, for my dwelling was far off and I was in the dwellings of the 
Chaos. </P>
<P>6. My power was in places which were not mine. </P>
<P>7. And I flattered those merciless ones, and when I flattered them, they 
attacked me without cause'." .</P>
<HR>

<P><STRONG>CHAPTER 53.</STRONG> </P>
<P>Now when Jesus had said these things to his disciples, he said to them : "Now 
at this time let him whose spirit moves him, come forth and say the 
interpretation of the tenth repentance of the Pistis Sophia." Peter answered and 
said : "O Lord, concerning this also, thy power prophesied once, through David, 
in the l19th Psalm, saying : </P>
<P>1. 'I cried to thee, O Lord, in my affliction and thou didst hear me. </P>
<P>2. O Lord, save my soul from unjust lips and from a cunning tongue. </P>
<P>3. What will be given to thee and what will be taken from thee with a cunning 
tongue? 4. The arrows of the strong are sharpened, together with the coals of 
the desert. </P>
<P>5. Woe on me, for my dwelling was far off. I dwelt in the dwellings of Kedar. 
6. My soul has been a sojourner in many places. </P>
<P>7. I was peaceful with those who hate peace. When I spoke with them they 
fought me without cause.' Now at this time, O Lord, this is the interpretation 
of the tenth repentance of the Pistis Sophia, which she said when the material 
emanations of the Authades oppressed her, they and his lion-faced power, and 
when they afflicted her greatly." Jesus said to him : "Excellent, Peter, and 
well done. This is the interpretation of the tenth repentance of the Pistis 
Sophia.".</P>
<HR>

<P><STRONG>CHAPTER 54.</STRONG> </P>
<P>Jesus continued again with the discourse, he said to his disciples: "Now it 
happened when the lion-faced power saw me approaching the Pistis Sophia, that I 
was shining exceedingly, it was more angry, and it emanated from itself another 
multitude of very powerful emanations. Now when these things happened, the 
Pistis Sophia spoke the eleventh repentance, saying : </P>
<P>1. 'Why has the strong power risen among the wicked? 2. Its thought took the 
light away from me at all times. </P>
<P>And like sharp iron they took power from me. </P>
<P>3. I preferred to come down to the Chaos more than to remain in the place of 
the thirteenth aeon, the place of righteousness. </P>
<P>4. And they wanted to take me by cunning, that they might swallow all my 
light. </P>
<P>5. Because of this now, the light will take all their light, and also their 
whole matter will be destroyed. And he will take their light, and he will not 
let them exist in the thirteenth aeon, their dwelling place, and he will not let 
their names be in the place of those that will live. </P>
<P>6. And the 24 emanations will see what has happened to thee, O lion-faced 
power, and they will fear and they will not be disobedient, but they will give 
what is purified of their light. </P>
<P>7. And they will see thee, and they will rejoice over thee and they will say 
: Behold an emanation which has not given what is purified of its light, that it 
might be saved, but it boasts of the magnitude of the light of its power, 
because it did not emanate the power within it ; and it said : I will take away 
the light of the Pistis Sophia, this which will be taken from her.' Now at this 
time, let him in whom his power has arisen come forward and give the 
interpretation of the eleventh repentance of the Pistis Sophia." Then Salome 
came forward and said : "My Lord, concerning this, thy light-power once 
prophesied, through David, in the 51st Psalm, saying : I. "why does the mighty, 
boast of his evil? 2. Thy tongue has devised injustice all the day; like a sharp 
cutting knife thou hast practiced deceit. </P>
<P>3. Thou hast loved evil more than goodness; thou host loved injustice more 
than to speak righteousness. 4. Thou hast loved all words of subterfuge and a 
cunning tongue, 5. For this reason God will destroy thee completely, He will 
uproot thee; and he will draw thee from thy dwelling, and he will pluck out thy 
root and cast it outside of those that are living, Pause. </P>
<P>6. The righteous will see and will fear; and they will mock at him and say : 
7. Behold a man who did not make God his helper, but he trusted in his great 
wealth and he had power upon his vanity. </P>
<P>8. But I am like a fruit-bearing olive tree in the House of God ; I have 
trusted in the mercy of God for ever and ever. </P>
<P>9. And I will give thanks to thee, for thou hast dealt with me ; and I will 
wait upon thy name, for it is beneficent in the presence of thy holy ones.' Now 
at this time, my Lord, this is the interpretation of the eleventh repentance of 
the Pistis Sophia. As thy light-power moved me, I said it according to thy 
will." Now it happened when Jesus heard these words which Salome said, he said : 
"Excellent, Salome. Truly, truly , I say to you that I will complete you in all 
mysteries of the Kingdom of the Light.".</P>
<HR>

<P><STRONG>CHAPTER 55.</STRONG> </P>
<P>Jesus, however, continued again with the discourse. </P>
<P>He said to his disciples : "It happened now after these things I entered into 
the Chaos, shining exceedingly, in order that I might take away the light of 
that lion-faced power. </P>
<P>As I was of exceeding light, it was afraid, it cried out to its deity, 
Authades, to help it. And at that hour the deity Authades looked forth from the 
thirteenth aeon, he looked down upon the Chaos. He was exceedingly angry, 
wishing to help his lion-faced power. And at that hour the lion-faced power and 
all its emanations turned to the Pistis Sophia, wishing to take away all the 
light which was in the Sophia. </P>
<P>It happened now when they oppressed the Sophia, she cried out to the height, 
she cried out to me, that I should help her. Now it happened when she looked to 
the height, she saw the Authades who was very angry, and she was afraid. </P>
<P>She said the twelfth repentance because of the Authades and his emanations. 
But she cried out to me, saying thus : </P>
<P>1. 'O Light, forget not my song of praise. </P>
<P>2. For the Authades and his lion-faced power opened their mouths against me, 
they dealt cunningly with me. 3. And they surrounded me, wishing to take away my 
power; and they hated me because I sang praises to thee. </P>
<P>4. Instead of loving me, they slandered me, but I sang praises. </P>
<P>5. They planned to take away my power because I sang praises to thee, O 
Light. And they hated me because I loved thee. </P>
<P>6. Let the darkness come over the Authades, and may the archon of the outer 
darkness remain at his right hand. </P>
<P>7. And when thou dost judge him, take his power away from him ; and that 
which he thought - to take away my light from me - do thou take his from him. 
</P>
<P>8. And may all his powers of his light within him diminish; and may another 
one take his greatness in the three triple-powered ones. </P>
<P>9. May all the powers of his emanations become without light; and may his 
matter be without light in it. </P>
<P>10. May his emanations remain in the Chaos, and may they not be allowed to go 
to their place; may their light which is in them diminish, and let them not be 
allowed to go up to the thirteenth aeon, their place. </P>
<P>11. May the paralemptes, the purifier of the lights, purify all the lights 
which are in the Authades; and may he take them from them. </P>
<P>12. May the archons of the darkness below rule over his emanations, and let 
not anyone receive him to himself in his place ; and let not anyone hear the 
power of his emanations in the Chaos. </P>
<P>13. May the light which is in his emanations be taken away, and may their 
name be removed from the thirteenth aeon; indeed rather may his name be taken 
away from that place for ever. </P>
<P>14. And upon the lion-faced power, may there be brought the sin of him who 
emanated it in the presence of the light; and may the iniquity, of the matter 
which brought him (the Authades) forth not be erased. </P>
<P>15. And may their sin immediately be in the presence of the eternal light ; 
and may they not be allowed to see, and may their name be removed from every 
place; 16. Because they did not spare me, and they oppressed the one whose light 
and power they took away. And afterwards they put me among them, wishing to take 
away all my light from me. </P>
<P>17. They loved to come down to the Chaos; may they be within it, and not be 
brought forth from this time hence. </P>
<P>They did not want the place of righteousness as dwelling place, and they will 
not be taken to it from this time forth. </P>
<P>18. He put on the darkness like a garment; and it (the darkness) went into 
him like water, and it went into all his powers like oil. </P>
<P>19. May he wrap himself in the Chaos like a garment, and gird himself with 
the darkness like a leather girdle at all times. 20. While these things happen 
to those who brought these things upon me on account of the light; and they 
said: let us take away all her power. </P>
<P>21. But thou, O Light, have compassion on me, on account of the mystery of 
thy name; and save me in the beneficence of thy mercy. </P>
<P>22. Because they have taken away my light and my power, and my power is 
shaken within me, and I have not been able to stand upright in their midst, 23. 
I have become like matter which has fallen; I have been cast on this side and 
that, like a demon which is in the air. </P>
<P>24. My power has been destroyed, for I possess no mystery ; and my matter has 
faded because of my light, for they took it away. </P>
<P>25. And as for me, they mocked me ; they looked at me as they winked about 
me. </P>
<P>26. Help me according to thy compassion.' Now at this time, he whose spirit 
is eager, let him come forward and say the interpretation of the twelfth 
repentance of the Pistis Sophia.".</P>
<HR>

<P><STRONG>CHAPTER 56.</STRONG> </P>
<P>Andrew however came forward, he said : "My Lord and Saviour, thy light-power 
prophesied once, through David, concerning this repentance which the Pistis 
Sophia said, and spoke in the 108th Psalm, saying : </P>
<P>1. 'O God, do not be silent to my praise. </P>
<P>2. For the mouths of the sinner and the cunning, they have opened against me 
; they have spoken about me with a cunning tongue. </P>
<P>3. And they surround me with words of hatred; and they have fought against me 
without a cause. </P>
<P>4. Instead of loving me, they slandered me, but I prayed. </P>
<P>5. They established for me evil in the place of good, and hatred in the place 
of my love. </P>
<P>6. Set a sinner over him, and let the devil stand at his right hand. </P>
<P>7. When he is judged, may he come forth condemned, and may his prayer become 
sin. </P>
<P>8. May his days be diminished, and may another take his office. </P>
<P>9. May his sons become orphans, and may his wife become a widow. </P>
<P>10. May his sons be moved, and may they be turned out and beg ; may they be 
cast forth from their house. </P>
<P>11. May the creditor search all his belongings; and may strangers rob all his 
efforts. </P>
<P>12. May there not exist for him anyone who gives him a hand, or who is 
compassionate to his orphans. </P>
<P>13. May his sons be blotted out; and may his name be blotted out in one 
generation. 14. May the sin of his fathers be remembered in the presence of the 
Lord ; and let not the iniquity of his mother be blotted out. </P>
<P>15. May they be in the presence of the Lord at all times ; and may his memory 
be wiped out from the earth. </P>
<P>16. Because he did not remember to show mercy; and he pursued a poor man and 
a wretched one, and he persecuted one who was afflicted, to kill him. </P>
<P>17. He loved cursing and may it come to him; he did not wish to bless and may 
it be removed from him. </P>
<P>18. He put on cursing like a garment, and it went to his interior like water; 
it became like oil in his bones. </P>
<P>19. May it be to him like the garment with which he will wrap himself; and 
like a girdle with which he will gird himself at all times. </P>
<P>20. This is the dealing for those that slander me before the Lord, and those 
that speak lawless things into my soul. </P>
<P>21. But thou, O Lord, Lord show mercy on me, on account of thy name; save me. 
</P>
<P>22. For I am a poor man and I am a wretched one ; my heart is agitated within 
me. </P>
<P>23. I have been taken into the midst like a shadow which goes down; I am 
blown forth like locusts. 24. My knees are weak with lasting; and my flesh is 
changed on account of the (lack of) oil. </P>
<P>25. But I have become a mockery to them; they saw me and they shook their 
heads. </P>
<P>26. Help me, O Lord God, and save me, according to thy mercy. </P>
<P>27. May they know that this is thy hand, and thou hast created it, O Lord.' 
This is the interpretation of the twelfth repentance which the Pistis Sophia 
said, as she was in the Chaos.". </P>
<HR>

<P><STRONG>CHAPTER 57.</STRONG> </P>
<P>Jesus continued again, however, with the discourse. </P>
<P>He said to his disciples : "It happened again after these things, the Pistis 
Sophia cried out to me, saying : 'O Light of Lights, I have transgressed against 
the twelve aeons. I came down from them. For this reason I have said the twelve 
repentances, one according to each aeon. Now at this time, O Light of Lights, 
forgive me my transgression, for it is very great. </P>
<P>Because I left the places of the height. I came to dwell in the places of the 
Chaos.' Now when the Pistis Sophia finished saying these things, she continued 
again with the thirteenth repentance, saying : </P>
<P>1. 'Hear me as I sing praises to thee, O Light of Lights. </P>
<P>Hear me as I say the repentance of the thirteenth aeon, the place from which 
I came down, so that the thirteenth repentance of the thirteenth aeon be 
completed. These (aeons) ( against which I have transgressed, from them I came 
down. </P>
<P>2. Now at this time, O Light of Lights, hear me as I sing praises to thee in 
the thirteenth aeon, my place from which I came forth. </P>
<P>3. Save me, O Light, in thy great mystery and forgive my transgression in thy 
forgiveness. </P>
<P>4. And give me the baptism and forgive my sins and purify me from my 
transgression. </P>
<P>5. And this my transgression is the lion-faced power, which was not hidden 
from thee at any time, for on account of it I came down. </P>
<P>6. And I alone among the invisible ones, in whose place I existed, 
transgressed, and I came down to the Chaos. </P>
<P>I transgressed before thee so that thy ordinance should be fulfilled.' The 
Pistis Sophia now said these things. Now at this time let him whose spirit moves 
him to understand her words, come forth and give their thought." Martha came 
forward and said: "My Lord, my spirit moves me to give the interpretation of 
those things which the Pistis Sophia said. Concerning them, thy power once 
prophesied through David in the 50th Psalm, speaking thus : </P>
<P>1. 'Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy great pity; according to the 
multitude of thy mercies blot out my sin . </P>
<P>2. Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity. 3. And my sin is present to me at all 
times. </P>
<P>4. That thou shouldst be justified in thy words and victorious when thou 
judgest me.' This is the explanation of the words which the Pistis Sophia said." 
Jesus said to her : ""Excellent, well done Martha, thou blessed one".</P>
<HR>

<P><STRONG>CHAPTER 58.</STRONG> </P>
<P>Jesus however continued again with the discourse. </P>
<P>He said to his disciples : "Now it happened when the Pistis Sophia said these 
words, the time was fulfilled that she should be brought forth from the Chaos. 
And by myself alone, without the First Mystery', I brought forth from myself a 
light-power, I sent it down to the Chaos that it should bring the Pistis Sophia 
up from the deep places of the Chaos and bring her to the upper place of the 
Chaos, until the command came forth from the First Mystery that she should be 
brought up from the Chaos completely. And my light-power brought the Pistis 
Sophia up to the upper places of the Chaos. Now it happened when the emanations 
of the Authades knew that the Pistis Sophia was brought up to the upper places 
of the Chaos, they followed her upwards, wanting to take her again to the lower 
places of the Chaos. And my light-power, which I had sent to bring the Sophia up 
from the Chaos, gave light exceedingly. Now it happened when the emanations of 
the Authades followed the Sophia when she was brought to the upper places of the 
Chaos, she sang praises again and she cried out to me, saying : I. 'I will sing 
praises to thee, O Light, for I wanted to come to thee. I will sing praises to 
thee, O Light, for thou art my Saviour. </P>
<P>2. Leave me not in the Chaos. Save me, O Light of the height, for thou art he 
to whom I have sung praises. </P>
<P>3. By thyself thou hast sent to me thy light and thou hast saved me. Thou 
hast brought me to the upper places of the Chaos. </P>
<P>4. May the emanations of the Authades which follow me fall down to the lower 
places of the Chaos. And let them not come to the upper places so that they see 
me. </P>
<P>5. And may a great darkness cover them over and may a cloud of darkness come 
to them. And let them not see me in the light of thy power which thou hast sent 
to me to save me, lest they gain power over me again. </P>
<P>6. And their plan which they thought of, to take away my power, let it not 
happen for them. And according to how they spoke against me to take away my 
light from me, take theirs rather instead of mine. </P>
<P>7. And they have spoken to take away all my light. And they were not able to 
take it, for thy light-power was with me ; 8. Because they deliberated without 
thy ordinance, O Light. </P>
<P>On account of this they were not able to take away my light. </P>
<P>9. Because I have believed in the light, I will not fear; and the light is my 
Saviour, and I will not fear.' Now at this time let him whose power is elevated 
say the interpretation of the words which the Pistis Sophia said." But it 
happened when Jesus finished saying these words to his disciples, Salome came 
forward. She said : "My Lord, my power compels me to say the interpretation of 
the words which the Pistis Sophia said. Thy power prophesied once through 
Solomon, saying thus : </P>
<P>1. I will give thanks to thee, O Lord, for thou art my God. </P>
<P>2. Leave me not, O Lord, for thou art my hope. </P>
<P>3. Thou hast given me thy judgment freely, and I have been saved through 
thee. </P>
<P>4. May those that persecute me fall and let them not see me. </P>
<P>5. May a cloud of smoke cover their eyes, and may a misty air darken them; 
and let them not see the day, lest they seize me. </P>
<P>6. May their counsels become powerless; and may those things which they have 
devised come upon them, 7. They have devised a counsel, and it has not happened 
for them. </P>
<P>8. And they, the powerful, are vanquished; and those things which they 
prepared with evil intent are cast down . </P>
<P>9. My hope is in the Lord and I will not fear ; for thou art my God, my 
Saviour'. " Now it happened when Salome finished saying these words, Jesus said 
to her : "Excellent, Salome, and well done. </P>
<P>This is the interpretation of the words which the Pistis Sophia said.".</P>
<HR>

<P><STRONG>CHAPTER 59.</STRONG> </P>
<P>Jesus continued again, however, with the discourse. </P>
<P>He said to his disciples : "Now it happened when the Pistis Sophia finished 
saying these words in the Chaos, I caused the light-power which I had sent to 
save her, I caused it to become a crown of light on her head, so that from this 
hour the emanations of the Authades would have no power over her. And when it 
became a crown of light on her head, all the evil materials which were in her 
were moved, and they were all purified within her; they were destroyed and came 
to be in the Chaos, while the emanations of the Authades saw them and they 
rejoiced. And what was purified of the pure light within the Sophia gave power 
to the light of my light-power which had become a crown on her head. Now it 
happened further, as it surrounded the pure light within the Sophia, her pure 
light was not (left) without 1 the crown of the flame of the light-power, so 
that the emanations of the Authades did not steal it. </P>
<P>Now when these things had happened, the pure light-power within the Sophia 
began to sing praises; but she sang praises to my light-power which had become a 
crown on her head. </P>
<P>She sang praises, saying thus : </P>
<P>1. 'The light has become a crown on my head and I will not be (left) without 
it, so that the emanations of the Authades do not steal it from me. </P>
<P>2. And even if all the materials move, I however will not move. </P>
<P>3. And even if all my materials are destroyed and remain in the Chaos - these 
which the emanations of the Authades see - I however will not be destroyed. </P>
<P>4. For the light is with me, and I myself am with the light.' But the Pistis 
Sophia said these words. Now at this time let him who understands the thought of 
these words come forward and give their interpretation." Mary, the mother of 
Jesus, came forward. She said : "My son according to the world, my God and my 
Saviour according to the height, command me that I give the explanation of the 
words which the Pistis Sophia said." But Jesus answered and said : "Thou also, 
Mary, thou hast received form which is in the Barbelo according to the matter, 
and thou hast received likeness which is in the on her head. Now it happened 
further, as it surrounded the pure light within the Sophia, her pure light was 
not (left) without the crown of the flame of the light-power, so that the 
emanations of the Authades did not steal it. </P>
<P>Now when these things had happened, the pure light-power within the Sophia 
began to sing praises; but she sang praises to my light-power which had become a 
crown on her head. </P>
<P>She sang praises, saying thus : </P>
<P>1. 'The light has become a crown on my head and I will not be (left) without 
it, so that the emanations of the Authades do not steal it from me. </P>
<P>2. And even if all the materials move, I however will not move. </P>
<P>3. And even if all my materials are destroyed and remain in the Chaos - these 
which the emanations of the Authades see - I however will not be destroyed. </P>
<P>4. For the light is with me, and I myself am with the light.' But the Pistis 
Sophia said these words. Now at this time let him who understands the thought of 
these words come forward and give their interpretation." Mary, the mother of 
Jesus, came forward. She said : "My son according to the world, my God and my 
Saviour according to the height, command me that I give the explanation of the 
words which the Pistis Sophia said." But Jesus answered and said : "Thou also, 
Mary, thou hast received form which is in the Barbelo according to the matter, 
and thou hast received likeness which is in the Virgin of the Light according to 
the light, thou and the other Mary, the blessed one. And for thy sake the 
darkness exists and furthermore, from thee has come forth the material body in 
which I exist, which I have cleaned and purified. Now at this time I command 
thee to give the interpretation of the words which the Sophia said. </P>
<P>However Mary, the mother of Jesus, answered, she said : "My Lord, thy 
light-power once prophesied about these words through Solomon in the 19th Ode 
and said : </P>
<P>1. 'The Lord is upon my head like a crown and I shall not be without him. 
</P>
<P>2. They plaited for me the true crown , and it caused thy branches to sprout 
in me. </P>
<P>3. For it is not like a withered crown which does not sprout; but thou livest 
upon my head and thou dost sprout upon me. </P>
<P>4. Thy fruits are full and ripe, filled with thy salvation'. " Now it 
happened when Jesus heard these words which Mary his mother spoke , he said to 
her : "Excellent, well done. </P>
<P>Truly, truly, I say that they will bless thee from end to end of the earth , 
for the pledge of the First Mystery was entrusted to thee. And by means of that 
pledge all those of the earth and all those of the height will be saved. And 
that pledge is the beginning and the end." .</P>
<HR>

<P><STRONG>CHAPTER 60</STRONG> Jesus however continued with the discourse. He 
said to his disciples : '"lt happened when the Pistis Sophia said the thirteenth 
repentance, moreover at that hour the ordinance was completed of all the 
afflictions which had been ordained for the Pistis Sophia, because of the 
completion of the First Mystery , which had been since the beginning. And the 
time came that she should be saved from the Chaos and brought forth from all the 
darknesses. For her repentance was received by the First Mystery'. And that 
Mystery sent me a great light-power from the height, so that I should help the 
Pistis Sophia and bring her up from the Chaos. But I looked to the aeons of the 
height , I saw the light-power which the First Mystery had sent to me so that I 
should save the Sophia from the Chaos. Now it happened, when I saw it coming 
forth from the aeons and it hastened towards me -- but I was above the Chaos - 
another light-power also came forth from me, in order to help the Pistis Sophia. 
And the light-power which came forth from the height through the First Mystery 
came down upon the light-power which came forth from me. And they met one 
another and became a great outpouring of light." Now when Jesus had said these 
things to his disciples he said: "Do you understand the manner in which I am 
speaking with you?" Mariam sprang up, she said : "My Lord, I understand what 
thou dost say. Concerning the interpretation of these words, thy light-power 
once prophesied through David in the 84th Psalm, saying : 10. 'Mercy and truth 
have met one another, and righteousness and peace have kissed one another. </P>
<P>11. Truth has sprouted from the earth and righteousness has looked forth from 
heaven.' Now mercy is the light-power which came forth through the First 
Mystery, for the First Mystery, heard the Pistis Sophia, and had mercy on her in 
all her afflictions. Truth, on the other hand, is the power which came forth 
from thee, because thou didst fulfill the truth that thou shouldst save her (the 
Pistis Sophia) from the Chaos. And furthermore, righteousness is the power which 
came forth through the First Mystery, which will guide the Pistis Sophia. And 
again peace is the power which came forth from thee, because it will go into the 
emanations of the Authades and take away from them the lights which they took 
from the Pistis Sophia; that is, thou dost gather them within the Sophia and 
dost make them to be at peace with her power. </P>
<P>Truth, on the other hand, is the power which came forth from thee when thou 
wast in the lower places of the Chaos. </P>
<P>Concerning this, thy power spoke through David thus: 'Truth has sprouted from 
the earth', because thou wast in the lower places of the Chaos. Righteousness, 
on the other hand, which looked forth from heaven, is the power which came forth 
from the height, through the First Mystery, and which entered into the 
Sophia.".</P>
<HR>

<P><STRONG>CHAPTER 61.</STRONG> </P>
<P>Now it happened when Jesus heard these words, he said: "Excellent, Mariam, 
thou blessed one who wilt inherit the whole Kingdom of the Light." After these 
things Mary, the mother of Jesus, also came forward and said: "My Lord and my 
Saviour, command me also that I answer this discourse." Jesus said: "I will not 
prevent him whose spirit has become understanding, but I urge him the more to 
speak the thought which has moved him. Now at this time, Mary, my mother 
according to the matter, to whom I was entrusted, I command thee that thou also 
sayest the thought of the discourse." Mary answered, however, and said : "My 
Lord, concerning the word which thy power prophesied through David : 10. 'Mercy 
and truth have met one another; righteousness and peace have kissed one another. 
</P>
<P>11. Truth has sprouted from the earth and righteousness has looked forth from 
heaven.' Thy power once prophesied in these words about thee. </P>
<P>When thou wast small, before the Spirit came upon thee, while thou wast in a 
vineyard with Joseph, the Spirit came forth from the height ø, he came to me 
into my house, he resembled thee. And I did not recognize him and I thought that 
he was thou. And the Spirit said to me : 'Where is Jesus, my brother, that I 
meet him ?' And when he said these things to me, I was confused and I thought 
that he was a phantom to tempt me. But I took him, I bound him to the leg of the 
bed in my house, until I came out to you in the field, thou and Joseph, and I 
found you in the vineyard, as Joseph was hedging the vineyard with reeds. Now it 
happened, when thou didst hear me speaking the word to Joseph, thou didst 
understand the word and thou didst rejoice. And thou didst say : 'Where is he 
that I may see him? Or else I await him in this place'. But it happened when 
Joseph heard thee saying these words, he was agitated and we came up at the same 
time, we went into the house. We found the Spirit bound to the bed. And we 
looked at thee with him, we found thee like him. And he that was bound to the 
bed was released, he embraced thee, he kissed thee. And thou also, thou didst 
kiss him and you became one. </P>
<P>This now is the discourse and its interpretation. Mercy is the Spirit which 
came forth from the height, through the First Mystery, because he (the First 
Mystery) had mercy on the race of men. He sent his Spirit that it should forgive 
the sins of the whole world so that they (men) should receive mysteries and 
inherit the Kingdom of the Light. Truth, on the other hand, is the power which 
was entrusted to me; when it came forth from the Barbelo, it became for thee a 
material body. And it preached about the place of the truth . Righteousness is 
thy Spirit which has brought the mysteries forth from the height, to give them 
to the race of mankind. Peace, on the other hand, is the power which was 
entrusted to thy material body ,, according to the world, which baptised the 
race of mankind until they became strangers to sin. And it made them to be at 
peace with thy Spirit, and they came to be at peace with the emanations of the 
light. That is, righteousness and peace have kissed one another. And as it was 
said : 'Truth has sprouted from the earth': truth however is thy material body , 
which sprouted from me, according to the earth of mankind, and which has 
preached about the place of the truth. And also as it was said: 'Righteousness 
(looked forth) from heaven': righteousness is the power which looked forth from 
the height, which will give the mysteries of the light to the race of mankind. 
And they will become righteous and good and inherit the Kingdom of the Light." 
Now it happened when Jesus heard these words which Mary his mother said, he said 
: "Excellent, well done, Mary. ".</P>
<HR>

<P><STRONG>CHAPTER 62</STRONG>. </P>
<P>The other Mary came forward and said : "My Lord, suffer me and be not angry 
with me, for since the time that thy mother spoke with thee concerning the 
interpretation of these words, my power has agitated me that I should come 
forward and also say the interpretation of these words. " Jesus said to her : "I 
command thee to say their interpretation." Maria said : "My Lord : 'Mercy and 
truth have met one another'. Now mercy is the Spirit which came down upon thee 
when thou didst receive baptism from John . Now mercy is the Spirit of Godhood 
which came forth upon thee, which had mercy upon the race of mankind. It came 
down, it met the power of Sabaoth the Good which is within thee and which has 
preached on the places of the truth. But it is said furthermore : 'Righteousness 
and peace have kissed one another. Now righteousness is the Spirit of the light, 
which came down upon thee, bringing the mysteries of the height in order to give 
them to the race of mankind. Peace, on the other hand, is the power of Sabaoth 
the Good which is within thee. It is this which baptised and forgave the race of 
mankind and made them to be at peace with the Sons of the Light . And 
furthermore, as thy power has said through David : 'Truth has sprouted from the 
earth' : that is, the power of Sabaoth the Good, [as it said : 'It sprouted from 
the earth'] it is this which sprouted from Mary thy mother, the earth-dweller . 
On the other hand, righteousness which looked forth from heaven ~ is the Spirit 
which is in the height, which has brought forth all the mysteries from the 
height. It gave them to the race of mankind, and they became righteous and good 
and they inherited the Kingdom of the Light." It happened however when Jesus 
finished hearing these words which Mariam spoke, he said; "Excellent, Mariam, 
thou inheritor of the light." Mary, the mother of Jesus, came forward again. She 
prostrated herself at his feet, she kissed them, and she said : "My Lord and my 
Son and my Saviour, be not angry with me, but forgive me that I say the 
interpretation of these words a second time: 'Mercy and truth have met one 
another'. I am Mary thy mother, and Elisabeth, the mother of John whom I met . 
Now mercy is the power in me of the Sabaoth which came forth from me , which is 
thou. </P>
<P>Thou hast had mercy on the whole race of mankind. On the other hand, truth is 
the power which was in Elisabeth, which is John who came and preached on the 
true way, which is thou, before whom he preached. And furthermore: 'Mercy and 
truth have met one another' : that is thou, my Lord, who didst meet John on the 
day when thou didst receive baptism . But furthermore, thou and John are 
righteousness and peace, which kissed one another. </P>
<P>'Truth has sprouted from the earth and righteousness has looked forth from 
heaven': that is the time when thou didst do service to thyself. Thou didst take 
the type of Gabriel, thou didst look down upon me from heaven , thou didst speak 
with me; and when thou didst speak with me thou didst sprout from me . That is, 
the truth which is the power of Sabaoth the Good which is in thy material body - 
that is the truth which sprouted from the earth. " Now it happened when Jesus 
heard these words which Mary, his mother, spoke, he said : "Excellent and well 
done. </P>
<P>This is the interpretation of all the words about which my light-power once 
prophesied through David the prophet. </P>
<P>These, however, are the names which I will give from the endless one. Write 
them with a sign so that the sons of God will be manifest from here. This is the 
name of the immortal one : []; and this is the name of the voice by which the 
perfect man is moved : [] But these are the interpretations of the names of 
these mysteries : the first name which is uuu, its interpretation is []; the 
second which is ppp, its interpretation is []; the third which is [], its 
interpretation is ooo, the fourth which is [], its interpretation is vvv, the 
fifth which is ôôô, its interpretation is aaa. That which is on the throne is 
uuu; this is the interpretation of the second : aaaa,aaaa,aaaa ; this is the 
interpretation of the whole name . </P>
