    <P>
    <H2 id="1">Chapter 1</H2>
    <h3>The crystal sea, God commands Adam, expelled from Eden,
        to live in the Cave of Treasures.</h3>    
    </P>

           <p>1 On the third day, God planted the garden in the east of the earth, on the
            border of the world eastward, beyond which, towards the sun-rising, one finds
            nothing but water, that encompasses the whole world, and reaches to the
            borders of heaven.</p>

           <p>2 And to the north of the garden there is a sea of water, clear and pure to the
            taste, unlike anything else; so that, through the clearness thereof, one may
            look into the depths of the earth.</p>

           <p>3 And when a man washes himself in it, he becomes clean of the cleanness
            thereof, and white of its whiteness—even if he were dark.</p>

           <p>4 And God created that sea of his own good pleasure, for He knew what would
            come of the man He would make; so that after he had left the garden, on
            account of his transgression, men should be born in the earth. Among them are
            righteous ones who will die, whose souls God would raise at the last day; when
            all of them will return to their flesh, bathe in the water of that sea, and repent
            of their sins.</p>

           <p>5 But when God made Adam go out of the garden, He did not place him on the
            border of it northward. This was so that he and Eve would not be able to go
            near to the sea of water where they could wash themselves in it, be cleansed
            from their sins, erase the transgression they had committed, and be no longer
            reminded of it in the thought of their punishment.</p>

           <p>6 As to the southern side of the garden, God did not want Adam to live there
            either; because, when the wind blew from the north, it would bring him, on that
            southern side, the delicious smell of the trees of the garden.</p>

           <p>7 Wherefore God did not put Adam there. This was so that he would not be
            able to smell the sweet smell of those trees, forget his transgression, and find
            consolation for what he had done by taking delight in the smell of the trees and
            yet not be cleansed from his transgression.</p>

           <p>8 Again, also, because God is merciful and of great pity, and governs all things
            in a way that He alone knows—He made our father Adam live in the western
            border of the garden, because on that side the earth is very broad.</p>

           <p>9 And God commanded him to live there in a cave in a rock—the Cave of
            Treasures below the garden.</p>

        <h3>Adam and Eve faint when they leave the Garden. God
            sends His Word to encourage them.</h3>
    </P>

            <p>1 But when our father Adam, and Eve, went out of the garden, they walked the
                ground on their feet, not knowing they were walking.</p>

            <p>2 And when they came to the opening of the gate of the garden, and saw the
                broad earth spread before them, covered with stones large and small, and with
                sand, they feared and trembled, and fell on their faces, from the fear that
                came over them; and they were as dead.</p>

            <p>3 Because—whereas until this time they had been in the garden land,
                beautifully planted with all manner of trees—they now saw themselves, in a
                strange land, which they knew not, and had never seen.</p>
            
            <p>4 And because, when they were in the garden they were filled with the grace of
                a bright nature, and they had not hearts turned toward earthly things.</p>

            <p>5 Therefore God had pity on them; and when He saw them fallen before the
                gate of the garden, He sent His Word to our father, Adam and Eve, and raised
                them from their fallen state.</p>

        <H2 id="3">Chapter 3</H2>
        <h3>Concerning the promise of the great five and a half days.</h3>
    </P>    

            <p>1 God said to Adam, "I have ordained on this earth days and years, and you
                and your descendants shall live and walk in them, until the days and years are
                fulfilled; when I shall send the Word that created you, and against which you
                have transgressed, the Word that made you come out of the garden, and that
                raised you when you were fallen.</p>

            <p>2 Yes, the Word that will again save you when the five and a half days are
                fulfilled."</p>

            <p>3 But when Adam heard these words from God, and of the great five and a half
                days, he did not understand the meaning of them.</p>

            <p>4 For Adam was thinking there would be only five and a half days for him until
                the end of the world.</p>

            <p>5 And Adam cried, and prayed to God to explain it to him.</p>

            <p>6 Then God in his mercy for Adam who was made after His own image and
                likeness, explained to him, that these were 5,000 and 500 years; and how One
                would then come and save him and his descendants.</p>

            <p>7 But before that, God had made this covenant with our father, Adam, in the
                same terms, before he came out of the garden, when he was by the tree where
                Eve took of the fruit and gave it to him to eat.</p>

            <p>8 Because, when our father Adam came out of the garden, he passed by that
                tree, and saw how God had changed the appearance of it into another form,
                and how it shriveled.</p>

            <p>9 And as Adam went to it he feared, trembled and fell down; but God in His
                mercy lifted him up, and then made this covenant with him.</p>

            <p>10 And again, when Adam was by the gate of the garden, and saw the cherub
                with a sword of flashing fire in his hand, and the cherub grew angry and
                frowned at him, both Adam and Eve became afraid of him, and thought he
                meant to put them to death. So they fell on their faces, trembled with fear.</p>

            <p>11 But he had pity on them, and showed them mercy; and turning from them
                went up to heaven, and prayed to the Lord, and said;—</p>

            <p>12 "Lord, You sent me to watch at the gate of the garden, with a sword of fire.</p>

            <p>13 But when Your servants, Adam and Eve, saw me, they fell on their faces,
                and were as dead. O my Lord, what shall we do to Your servants?"</p>

            <p>14 Then God had pity on them, and showed them mercy, and sent His Angel to
                keep the garden.</p>

            <p>15 And the Word of the Lord came to Adam and Eve, and raised them up.</p>

            <p>16 And the Lord said to Adam, "I told you that at the end of the five and a half
                days, I will send my Word and save you.</p>

            <p>17 Strengthen your heart, therefore, and stay in the Cave of Treasures, of
                which I have before spoken to you."</p>

            <p>18 And when Adam heard this Word from God, he was comforted with that
                which God had told him. For He had told him how He would save him.</p>

                </P>   

 
                <p>1 But Adam and Eve cried for having come out of the garden, their first home.</p>

                <p>2 And indeed, when Adam looked at his flesh, that was altered, he cried
                    bitterly, he and Eve, over what they had done. And they walked and went
                    gently down into the Cave of Treasures.</p>

                <p>3 And as they came to it, Adam cried over himself and said to Eve, "Look at
                    this cave that is to be our prison in this world, and a place of punishment!</p>

                <p>4 What is it compared with the garden? What is its narrowness compared with
                    the space of the other?</p>

                <p>5 What is this rock, by the side of those groves? What is the gloom of this
                    cavern, compared with the light of the garden?</p>

                <p>6 What is this overhanging ledge of rock to shelter us, compared with the
                    mercy of the Lord that overshadowed us?</p>

                <p>7 What is the soil of this cave compared with the garden land? This earth,
                    strewed with stones; and that, planted with delicious fruit trees?"</p>

                <p>8 And Adam said to Eve, "Look at your eyes, and at mine, which before beheld
                    angels praising in heaven; and they too, without ceasing.</p>

                <p>9 But now we do not see as we did; our eyes have become of flesh; they
                    cannot see like they used to see before."</p>

                <p>10 Adam said again to Eve, "What is our body today, compared to what it was
                    in former days, when we lived in the garden?"</p>

                <p>11 After this, Adam did not want to enter the cave, under the overhanging
                    rock; nor would he ever want to enter it.</p>

                <p>12 But he bowed to God's orders; and said to himself, "Unless I enter the cave,
                    I shall again be a transgressor."</p>

                        blame on herself.</h3>
                </P>   

                <p>1 Then Adam and Eve entered the cave, and stood praying, in their own
                    tongue, unknown to us, but which they knew well.</p>

                <p>2 And as they prayed, Adam raised his eyes and saw the rock and the roof of
                    the cave that covered him overhead. This prevented him from seeing either
                    heaven or God's creatures. So he cried and beat his chest hard, until he
                    dropped, and was as dead.</p>

                <p>3 And Eve sat crying; for she believed he was dead.</p>

                <p>4 Then she got up, spread her hands toward God, appealing to Him for mercy
                    and pity, and said, "O God, forgive me my sin, the sin which I committed, and
                    don't remember it against me.</p>

                <p>5 For I alone caused Your servant to fall from the garden into this condemned
                    land; from light into this darkness; and from the house of joy into this prison.</p>

                <p>6 O God, look at this Your servant fallen in this manner, and bring him back to
                    life, that he may cry and repent of his transgression which he committed
                    through me.</p>

                <p>7 Don't take away his soul right now; but let him live that he may stand after
                    the measure of his repentance, and do Your will, as before his death.</p>

                <p> 8 But if You do not bring him back to life, then, O God, take away my own soul,
                    that I be like him, and leave me not in this dungeon, one and alone; for I could
                    not stand alone in this world, but with him only.</p>

                <p>9 For You, O God, caused him to fall asleep, and took a bone from his side, and
                    restored the flesh in the place of it, by Your divine power.</p>

                <p>10 And You took me, the bone, and make me a woman, bright like him, with
                    heart, reason, and speech; and in flesh, like to his own; and You made me after
                    the likeness of his looks, by Your mercy and power.</p>

                <p>11 O Lord, I and he are one, and You, O God, are our Creator, You are He who
                    made us both in one day.</p>

                <p>12 Therefore, O God, give him life, that he may be with me in this strange land,
                    while we live in it on account of our transgression.</p>

                <p>13 But if You will not give him life, then take me, even me, like him; that we
                    both may die the same day."</p>

                <p>14 And Eve cried bitterly, and fell on our father Adam; from her great sorrow.</p>

                </P>   

                <p>1 But God looked at them; for they had killed themselves through great grief.</p>

                <p>2 But He decided to raise them and comfort them.</p>

                <p>3 He, therefore, sent His Word to them; that they should stand and be raised
                    immediately.</p>

                <p>4 And the Lord said to Adam and Eve, "You transgressed of your own free will,
                    until you came out of the garden in which I had placed you.</p>

                <p>5 Of your own free will have you transgressed through your desire for divinity,
                    greatness, and an exalted state, such as I have; so that I deprived you of the
                    bright nature in which you then were, and I made you come out of the garden
                    to this land, rough and full of trouble.</p>

                <p>6 If only you had not transgressed My commandment and had kept My law,
                    and had not eaten of the fruit of the tree which I told you not to come near!
                    And there were fruit trees in the garden better than that one.</p>

                <p>7 But the wicked Satan did not keep his faith and had no good intent towards
                    Me, that although I had created him, he considered Me to be useless, and
                    sought the Godhead for himself; for this I hurled him down from heaven so that
                    he could not remain in his first estate—it was he who made the tree appear
                    pleasant in your eyes, until you ate of it, by believing his words.</p>

                <p>8 Thus have you transgressed My commandment, and therefore I have brought
                    on you all these sorrows.</p>

                <p>9 For I am God the Creator, who, when I created My creatures, did not intend to
                    destroy them. But after they had sorely roused My anger, I punished them with
                    grievous plagues, until they repent.</p>

                <p>10 But, if on the contrary, they still continue hardened in their transgression,
                    they shall be under a curse forever."</p>

                    more; but they strengthened their hearts in God, because they now felt that
                    the Lord was to them like a father and a mother; and for this very reason, they
                    cried before Him, and sought mercy from Him.</p>

                <p>2 Then God had pity on them, and said: "O Adam, I have made My covenant
                    with you, and I will not turn from it; neither will I let you return to the garden,
                    until My covenant of the great five and a half days is fulfilled."</p>
                    
                <p>3 Then Adam said to God, "O Lord, You created us, and made us fit to be in the
                    garden; and before I transgressed, You made all beasts come to me, that I
                    should name them.</p>

                <p>4 Your grace was then on me; and I named every one according to Your mind;
                    and you made them all subject to me.</p>

                <p>5 But now, O Lord God, that I have transgressed Your commandment, all
                    beasts will rise against me and will devour me, and Eve Your handmaid; and
                    will cut off our life from the face of the earth.</p>

                <p>6 I therefore beg you, O God, that since You have made us come out of the
                    garden, and have made us be in a strange land, You will not let the beasts hurt
                    us."</p>

                <p>7 When the Lord heard these words from Adam, He had pity on him, and felt
                    that he had truly said that the beasts of the field would rise and devour him
                    and Eve, because He, the Lord, was angry with the two of them on account of
                    their transgressions.</p>

                <p>8 Then God commanded the beasts, and the birds, and all that moves on the
                    earth, to come to Adam and to be familiar with him, and not to trouble him and
                    Eve; nor yet any of the good and righteous among their offspring.</p>

                <p>9 Then all the beasts paid homage to Adam, according to the commandment of
                    God; except the serpent, against which God was angry. It did not come to
                    Adam, with the beasts.</p>
                
                    <br>

                    <h3>The "Bright Nature" of man is taken away.</h3>
                </P>   

                <p>1 Then Adam cried and said, "O God, when we lived in the garden, and our
                    hearts were lifted up, we saw the angels that sang praises in heaven, but now
                    we can't see like we used to; no, when we entered the cave, all creation
                    became hidden from us."</p>

                <p>2 Then God the Lord said to Adam, "When you were under subjection to Me,
                    you had a bright nature within you, and for that reason could you see things far
                    away. But after your transgression your bright nature was withdrawn from you;
                    and it was not left to you to see things far away, but only near at hand; after
                    the ability of the flesh; for it is brutish."</p>

                <p>3 When Adam and Eve had heard these words from God, they went their way;
                    praising and worshipping Him with a sorrowful heart.</p>

                <p>4 And God ceased to commune with them.</p>

                    <h3>Water from the Tree of Life. Adam and Eve near drowning.</h3>
                </P>   
  
                <p>1 Then Adam and Eve came out of the Cave of Treasures, and went near to the
                    garden gate, and there they stood to look at it, and cried for having come away
                    from it.</p>

                <p>2 And Adam and Eve went from before the gate of the garden to the southern
                    side of it, and found there the water that watered the garden, from the root of
                    the Tree of Life, and that split itself from there into four rivers over the earth.</p>

                <p>3 Then they came and went near to that water, and looked at it; and saw that
                    it was the water that came forth from under the root of the Tree of Life in the
                    garden.</p>

                <p>4 And Adam cried and wailed, and beat his chest, for being severed from the
                    garden; and said to Eve:—</p>

                <p>5 "Why have you brought on me, on yourself, and on our descendants, so
                    many of these plagues and punishments?"</p>

                <p>6 And Eve said to him, "What is it you have seen that has caused you to cry
                    and to speak to me in this manner?"</p>

                <p>7 And he said to Eve, "Do you not see this water that was with us in the
                    garden, that watered the trees of the garden, and flowed out from there?</p>

                <p>8 And we, when we were in the garden, did not care about it; but since we
                    came to this strange land, we love it, and turn it to use for our body."</p>

                <p>9 But when Eve heard these words from him, she cried; and from the soreness
                    of their crying, they fell into that water; and would have put an end to
                    themselves in it, so as never again to return and behold the creation; for when
                    they looked at the work of creation, they felt they must put an end to
                    themselves.</p>

                <p>1 Then God, merciful and gracious, looked at them thus lying in the water, and
                    close to death, and sent an angel, who brought them out of the water, and laid
                    them on the seashore as dead.</p>

                <p>2 Then the angel went up to God, was welcome, and said, "O God, Your
                    creatures have breathed their last."</p>

                <p>3 Then God sent His Word to Adam and Eve, who raised them from their death.</p>

                <p>4 And Adam said, after he was raised, "O God, while we were in the garden we
                    did not require, or care for this water; but since we came to this land we
                    cannot do without it."</p>

                <p>5 Then God said to Adam, "While you were under My command and were a
                    bright angel, you knew not this water.</p>

                <p>6 But now that you have transgressed My commandment, you can not do
                    without water, wherein to wash your body and make it grow; for it is now like
                    that of beasts, and is in want of water."</p>

                <p>7 When Adam and Eve heard these words from God, they cried a bitter cry;
                    and Adam entreated God to let him return into the garden, and look at it a
                    second time.</p>

                <p>8 But God said to Adam, "I have made you a promise; when that promise is
                    fulfilled, I will bring you back into the garden, you and your righteous
                    descendants."</p>

                <p>1 Then Adam and Eve felt themselves burning with thirst, and heat, and
                    sorrow.</p>

                <p>2 And Adam said to Eve, "We shall not drink of this water, even if we were to

                    punishments and that of our descendants."</p>

                <p>3 Both Adam and Eve then went away from the water, and drank none of it at
                    all; but came and entered the Cave of Treasures.</p>

                <p>4 But when in it Adam could not see Eve; he only heard the noise she made.
                    Neither could she see Adam, but heard the noise he made.</p>

                <p>5 Then Adam cried, in deep affliction, and beat his chest; and he got up and
                    said to Eve, "Where are you?"</p>

                <p>6 And she said to him, "Look, I am standing in this darkness."</p>

                <p>7 He then said to her, "Remember the bright nature in which we lived, when
                    we lived in the garden!</p>

                <p>8 O Eve! Remember the glory that rested on us in the garden. O Eve!
                    Remember the trees that overshadowed us in the garden while we moved
                    among them.</p>

                <p>9 O Eve! Remember that while we were in the garden, we knew neither night
                    nor day. Think of the Tree of Life, from below which flowed the water, and that
                    shed lustre over us! Remember, O Eve, the garden land, and the brightness
                    thereof!</p>

                <p>10 Think, oh think of that garden in which was no darkness, while we lived in it.</p>

                <p>11 Whereas no sooner did we come into this Cave of Treasures than darkness
                    surrounded us all around; until we can no longer see each other; and all the
                    pleasure of this life has come to an end."</p>

                </P>   

                <p>1 Then Adam beat his chest, he and Eve, and they mourned the whole night
                    until the crack of dawn, and they sighed over the length of the night in Miyazia.</p>

                <p>2 And Adam beat himself, and threw himself on the ground in the cave, from
                    bitter grief, and because of the darkness, and lay there as dead.</p>

                <p>3 But Eve heard the noise he made in falling on the ground. And she felt about
                    for him with her hands, and found him like a corpse.</p>

                <p>4 Then she was afraid, speechless, and remained by him.</p>

                <p>5 But the merciful Lord looked on the death of Adam, and on Eve's silence from
                    fear of the darkness.</p>

                <p>6 And the Word of God came to Adam and raised him from his death, and
                    opened Eve's mouth that she might speak.</p>

                <p>7 Then Adam stood up in the cave and said, "O God, why has light departed
                    from us, and darkness covered us? Why did you leave us in this long darkness?
                    Why do you plague us like this?</p>

                <p>8 And this darkness, O Lord, where was it before it covered us? It is because of
                    this that we cannot see each other.</p>

                <p>9 For so long as we were in the garden, we neither saw nor even knew what
                    darkness is. I was not hidden from Eve, neither was she hidden from me, until
                    now that she cannot see me; and no darkness came over us to separate us
                    from each other.</p>

                <p>10 But she and I were both in one bright light. I saw her and she saw me. Yet
                    now since we came into this cave, darkness has covered us, and separated us
                    from each other, so that I do not see her, and she does not see me.</p>

                <p>11 O Lord, will You then plague us with this darkness?"</p>

                </P>   


                <p>1 Then when God, who is merciful and full of pity, heard Adam's voice, He said
                    to him:—</p>

                <p>2 "O Adam, so long as the good angel was obedient to Me, a bright light rested
                    on him and on his hosts.</p>

                <p>3 But when he transgressed My commandment, I deprived him of that bright
                    nature, and he became dark.</p>

                <p>4 And when he was in the heavens, in the realms of light, he knew nothing of
                    darkness.</p>

                <p>5 But he transgressed, and I made him fall from the heaven onto the earth;
                    and it was this darkness that came over him.</p>

                <p>6 And on you, O Adam, while in My garden and obedient to Me, did that bright
                    light rest also.</p>

                <p>7 But when I heard of your transgression, I deprived you of that bright light.
                    Yet, of My mercy, I did not turn you into darkness, but I made you your body of
                    flesh, over which I spread this skin, in order that it may bear cold and heat.</p>

                <p>8 If I had let My wrath fall heavily on you, I should have destroyed you; and had
                    I turned you into darkness, it would have been as if I had killed you.</p>

                <p>9 But in My mercy, I have made you as you are; when you transgressed My
                    commandment, O Adam, I drove you from the garden, and made you come
                    forth into this land; and commanded you to live in this cave; and darkness
                    covered you, as it did over him who transgressed My commandment.</p>

                <p>10 Thus, O Adam, has this night deceived you. It is not to last forever; but is
                    only of twelve hours; when it is over, daylight will return.</p>

                <p>11 Sigh not, therefore, neither be moved; and say not in your heart that this
                    darkness is long and drags on wearily; and say not in your heart that I plague
                    you with it.</p>

                <p>12 Strengthen your heart, and be not afraid. This darkness is not a
                    punishment. But, O Adam, I have made the day, and have placed the sun in it
                    to give light; in order that you and your children should do your work.</p>

                <p>13 For I knew you would sin and transgress, and come out into this land. Yet I
                    wouldn't force you, nor be heard over you, nor shut up; nor doom you through
                    your fall; nor through your coming out from light into darkness; nor yet through
                    your coming from the garden into this land.</p>

                <p>14 For I made you of the light; and I willed to bring out children of light from
                    you and like to you.</p>

                <p>15 But you did not keep My commandment one day; until I had finished the
                creation and blessed everything in it.</p>

                <p>16 Then, concerning the tree, I commanded you not to eat of it. Yet I knew that
                    Satan, who deceived himself, would also deceive you.</p>

                <p>17 So I made known to you by means of the tree, not to come near him. And I
                    told you not to eat of the fruit thereof, nor to taste of it, nor yet to sit under it,
                    nor to yield to it.</p>

                <p>18 Had I not been and spoken to you, O Adam, concerning the tree, and had I
                    left you without a commandment, and you had sinned—it would have been an
                    offence on My part, for not having given you any order; you would turn around
                    and blame Me for it.</p>

                <p>19 But I commanded you, and warned you, and you fell. So that My creatures
                    cannot blame Me; but the blame rests on them alone.</p>

                <p>20 And, O Adam, I have made the day so that you and your descendants can
                    work and toil in it. And I have made the night for them to rest in it from their
                    work; and for the beasts of the field to go forth by night and look for their food.</p>

                <p>21 But little of darkness now remains, O Adam, and daylight will soon appear."</p>

                </P>   

                <p>1 Then Adam said to God: "O Lord, take my soul, and let me not see this
                    gloom any more; or remove me to some place where there is no darkness."</p>

                <p>2 But God the Lord said to Adam, "Indeed I say to you, this darkness will pass
                    from you, every day I have determined for you, until the fulfillment of My
                    covenant; when I will save you and bring you back again into the garden, into
                    the house of light you long for, in which there is no darkness*. I will bring you
                    to it—in the kingdom of heaven."</p>

                <p>3 Again said God to Adam, "All this misery that you have been made to take on
                    yourself because of your transgression, will not free you from the hand of
                    Satan, and will not save you.</p>

                <p>4 But I will. When I shall come down from heaven, and shall become flesh of
                    your descendants, and take on Myself the infirmity from which you suffer, then
                    the darkness that covered you in this cave shall cover Me in the grave, when I
                    am in the flesh of your descendants.</p>

                <p>5 And I, who am without years, shall be subject to the reckoning of years, of
                    times, of months, and of days, and I shall be reckoned as one of the sons of
                    men, in order to save you."</p>

                                3 He was despised and rejected by mankind,
                                    a man of suffering, and familiar with pain.
                                Like one from whom people hide their faces
                                    he was despised, and we held him in low esteem.

                                4 Surely he took up our pain
                                    and bore our suffering,
                                yet we considered him punished by God,
                                    stricken by him, and afflicted.
                                5 But he was pierced for our transgressions,
                                    he was crushed for our iniquities;
                                the punishment that brought us peace was on him,
                                    and by his wounds we are healed.
                                6 We all, like sheep, have gone astray,
                                    each of us has turned to our own way;
                                and the Lord has laid on him
                                    the iniquity of us all.

                                7 He was oppressed and afflicted,
                                    yet he did not open his mouth;
                                he was led like a lamb to the slaughter,
                                    and as a sheep before its shearers is silent,
                                    so he did not open his mouth.
                                8 By oppression[a] and judgment he was taken away.
                                    Yet who of his generation protested?
                                For he was cut off from the land of the living;
                                    for the transgression of my people he was punished.
                                9 He was assigned a grave with the wicked,
                                    and with the rich in his death,
                                though he had done no violence,
                                    nor was any deceit in his mouth.

                                10 Yet it was the Lord's will to crush him and cause him to suffer,
                                    and though the Lord makes his life an offering for sin,
                                he will see his offspring and prolong his days,
                                    and the will of the Lord will prosper in his hand. NIV</span>

                <p>1 Then Adam and Eve cried and sorrowed by reason of God's word to them,
                    that they should not return to the garden until the fulfillment of the days
                    decreed on them; but mostly because God had told them that He should suffer
                    for their salvation.</p>

                        to burn them.</h3>
                </P>   

                <p>1 After this, Adam and Eve continued to stand in the cave, praying and crying,
                    until the morning dawned on them.</p>

                <p>2 And when they saw the light returned to them, they retrained from fear, and
                    strengthened their hearts.</p>

                <p>3 Then Adam began to come out of the cave. And when he came to the mouth
                    of it, and stood and turned his face towards the east, and saw the sunrise in
                    glowing rays, and felt the heat thereof on his body, he was afraid of it, and
                    thought in his heart that this flame came forth to plague him.</p>

                <p>4 He then cried and beat his chest, then he fell on the ground on his face and
                    made his request, saying:—</p>

                <p>5 "O Lord, plague me not, neither consume me, nor yet take away my life from
                    the earth."</p>

                <p>6 For he thought the sun was God.</p>

                <p>7 Because while he was in the garden and heard the voice of God and the
                    sound He made in the garden, and feared Him, Adam never saw the brilliant
                    light of the sun, neither did its flaming heat touch his body.</p>

                <p>8 Therefore he was afraid of the sun when flaming rays of it reached him. He
                    thought God meant to plague him therewith all the days He had decreed for
                    him.</p>

                <p>9 For Adam also said in his thoughts, as God did not plague us with darkness,
                    behold, He has caused this sun to rise and to plague us with burning heat.
                    10 But while he was thinking like this in his heart, the Word of God came to
                    him and said:—</p>

                <p>11 "O Adam, get up on your feet. This sun is not God; but it has been created
                    to give light by day, of which I spoke to you in the cave saying, 'that the dawn
                    would come, and there would be light by day.'</p>

                <p>12 But I am God who comforted you in the night."</p>

                <p>13 And God ceased to commune with Adam.</p>

                <p>1 The Adam and Eve came out at the mouth of the cave, and went towards the
                    garden.</p>

                <p>2 But as they went near it, before the western gate, from which Satan came
                    when he deceived Adam and Eve, they found the serpent that became Satan
                    coming at the gate, and sorrowfully licking the dust, and wiggling on its breast
                    on the ground, by reason of the curse that fell on it from God.</p>

                <p>3 And whereas before the serpent was the most exalted of all beasts, now it
                    was changed and become slippery, and the meanest of them all, and it crept
                    on its breast and went on its belly.</p>

                <p>4 And whereas it was the fairest of all beasts, it had been changed, and was
                    become the ugliest of them all. Instead of feeding on the best food, now it
                    turned to eat the dust. Instead of living, as before, in the best places, now it
                    lived in the dust.</p>

                <p>5 And, whereas it had been the most beautiful of all beasts, all of which stood
                    dumb at its beauty, it was now abhorred of them.</p>

                <p>6 And, again, whereas it lived in one beautiful home, to which all other animals
                    came from elsewhere; and where it drank, they drank also of the same; now,
                    after it had become venomous, by reason of God's curse, all beasts fled from
                    its home, and would not drink of the water it drank; but fled from it.</p>

                        and all wild animals!
                    You will crawl on your belly
                        and you will eat dust
                        all the days of your life.
                    15 And I will put enmity
                        between you and the woman,
                        and between your offspring[a] and hers;
                    he will crush[b] your head,
                        and you will strike his heel.” NIV</span>

                    <h3>The mortal combat with the serpent.</h3>
                </P>   

                <p>1 When the accursed serpent saw Adam and Eve, it swelled its head, stood on
                    its tail, and with eyes blood-red, acted like it would kill them.</p>

                <p>2 It made straight for Eve, and ran after her; while Adam standing by, cried
                    because he had no stick in his hand with which to hit the serpent, and did not
                    know how to put it to death.</p>

                <p>3 But with a heart burning for Eve, Adam approached the serpent, and held it
                    by the tail; when it turned towards him and said to him:—</p>

                <p>4 "O Adam, because of you and of Eve, I am slippery, and go on my belly."
                    Then with its great strength, it threw down Adam and Eve and squeezed them,
                    and tried to kill them.</p>

                <p>5 But God sent an angel who threw the serpent away from them, and raised
                    them up.</p>

                <p>6 Then the Word of God came to the serpent, and said to it, "The first time I
                    made you slick, and made you to go on your belly; but I did not deprive you of
                    speech.</p>

                <p>7 This time, however, you will be mute, and you and your race will speak no
                    more; because, the first time My creatures were ruined because of you, and
                    this time you tried to kill them."</p>

                <p>8 Then the serpent was struck mute, and was no longer able to speak.</p>

                <p>9 And a wind blew down from heaven by the command of God and carried
                    away the serpent from Adam and Eve, and threw it on the seashore where it
                    landed in India.</p>

                    <h3>Beasts made subject to Adam.</h3>
                </P>   

                <p>1 But Adam and Eve cried before God. And Adam said to Him:—</p>

                <p>2 "O Lord, when I was in the cave, I said this to you, my Lord, the beasts of the
                    field would rise and devour me, and cut off my life from the earth."</p>

                <p>3 Then Adam, because of what had happened to him, beat his chest and fell on
                    the ground like a corpse. Then the Word of God came to him, who raised him,
                    and said to him,</p>

                <p>4 "O Adam, not one of these beasts will be able to hurt you; because I have
                    made the beasts and other moving things come to you in the cave. I did not let
                    the serpent come with them because it might have risen against you and made
                    you tremble; and the fear of it should fall into your hearts.</p>

                <p>5 For I knew that the accursed one is wicked; therefore I would not let it come
                    near you with the other beasts.</p>

                <p>6 But now strengthen your heart and fear not. I am with you to the end of the
                    days I have determined on you."</p>
                

                <P>
                    <H2 id="20">Chapter 20</H2>
                    <h3>Adam wishes to protect Eve.</h3>
                </P>   

                <p>1 Then Adam cried and said, "O God, take us away to some other place, where
                    the serpent can not come near us again, and rise against us. For fear that it
                    might find Your handmaid Eve alone and kill her; for its eyes are hideous and
                    evil."</p>

                <p>2 But God said to Adam and Eve, "From now on, don't be afraid, I will not let it
                    come near you; I have driven it away from you, from this mountain; neither will
                    I leave in it the ability to hurt you."</p>

                <p>3 Then Adam and Eve worshipped before God and gave Him thanks, and
                    praised Him for having delivered them from death.</p>

                    <h3>Adam and Eve attempt suicide.</h3>
                </P>   

                <p>1 Then Adam and Eve went in search of the garden.</p>

                <p>2 And the heat beat like a flame on their faces; and they sweated from the
                    heat, and cried before the Lord.</p>

                <p>3 But the place where they cried was close to a high mountain, facing the
                    western gate of the garden.</p>

                <p>4 Then Adam threw himself down from the top of that mountain; his face was
                    torn and his flesh was ripped; he lost a lot of blood and was close to death.</p>

                <p>5 Meanwhile Eve remained standing on the mountain crying over him, thus
                    lying.</p>

                <p>6 And she said, "I don't wish to live after him; for all that he did to himself was
                    through me."</p>

                <p>7 Then she threw herself after him; and was torn and ripped by stones; and
                    remained lying as dead.</p>

                <p>8 But the merciful God, who looks over His creatures, looked at Adam and Eve
                    as they lay dead, and He sent His Word to them, and raised them.</p>

                <p>9 And said to Adam, "O Adam, all this misery which you have brought on
                    yourself, will have no affect against My rule, neither will it alter the covenant of
                    the 5, 500 years."</p>
                

                <P>
                    <H2 id="22">Chapter 22</H2>
                    <h3>Adam in a gracious mood.</h3>
                </P>   

                <p>1 Then Adam said to God, "I dry up in the heat, I am faint from walking, and I
                    don't want to be in this world. And I don't know when You will take me out of it
                    to rest."</p>

                <p>2 Then the Lord God said to him, "O Adam, it cannot be now, not until you have
                    ended your days. Then shall I bring you out of this miserable land."</p>

                <p>3 And Adam said to God, "While I was in the garden I knew neither heat, nor
                    languor, neither moving about, nor trembling, nor fear; but now since I came to
                    this land, all this affliction has come over me.</p>

                <p>4 Then God said to Adam, "So long as you were keeping My commandment, My
                    light and My grace rested on you. But when you transgressed My
                    commandment, sorrow and misery came to you in this land."</p>

                <p>5 And Adam cried and said, "O Lord, do not cut me off for this, neither punish
                    me with heavy plagues, nor yet repay me according to my sin; for we, of our
                    own will, transgressed Your commandment, and ignored Your law, and tried to
                    become gods like you, when Satan the enemy deceived us."</p>

                <p>6 Then God said again to Adam, "Because you have endured fear and
                    trembling in this land, languor and suffering, treading and walking about, going
                    on this mountain, and dying from it, I will take all this on Myself in order to
                    save you."</p>

                <P>
                    <H2 id="23">Chapter 23</H2>
                    <h3>Adam and Eve strengthen themselves and make the
                        first altar ever built.</h3>
                </P>   

                <p>1 Then Adam cried more and said, "O God, have mercy on me, so far as to take
                    on yourself, that which I will do."</p>

                <p>2 But God withdrew His Word from Adam and Eve.</p>

                <p>3 Then Adam and Eve stood on their feet; and Adam said to Eve, "Strengthen
                    yourself, and I also will strengthen myself." And she strengthened herself, as
                    Adam told her.</p>

                <p>4 Then Adam and Eve took stones and placed them in the shape of an altar;
                    and they took leaves from the trees outside the garden, with which they wiped,
                    from the face of the rock, the blood they had spilled.</p>

                <p>5 But that which had dropped on the sand, they took together with the dust
                    with which it was mingled and offered it on the altar as an offering to God.</p>

                <p>6 Then Adam and Eve stood under the Altar and cried, thus praying to God,
                    "Forgive us our trespass* and our sin, and look at us with Thine eye of mercy.
                    For when we were in the garden our praises and our hymns went up before you
                    without ceasing.</p>

                <p>7 But when we came into this strange land, pure praise was not longer ours,
                    nor righteous prayer, nor understanding hearts, nor sweet thoughts, nor just
                    counsels, nor long discernment, nor upright feelings, neither is our bright
                    nature left us. But our body is changed from the likeness in which it was at
                    first, when we were created.</p>

                <p>8 Yet now look at our blood which is offered on these stones, and accept it at
                    our hands, like the praise we used to sing to you at first, when in the garden."
                    9 And Adam began to make more requests of God.</p>

                <p> * ORIGINAL OF THE LORD'S PRAYER SAID TO BE USED ABOUT 150 YEARS BEFORE OUR LORD:
                    Our Father, Who art in Heaven, be gracious unto us, O Lord our God, hallowed be Your Name,
                    and let the remembrance of Thee be glorified Heaven above and upon earth here below.
                    Let Your kingdom reign over us now and forever. The Holy Men of old said remit and forgive
                    unto all men whatsoever they have done unto me. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver
                    us from the evil thing; for Thine is the kingdom and Thou shalt reign in glory forever and
                    forevermore, AMEN.</p>

                    <H2 id="24">Chapter 24</H2>
                    <h3>A vivid prophecy of the life and death of Christ.</h3>
                </P>   

                <p>1 Then the merciful God, good and lover of men, looked at Adam and Eve, and
                    at their blood, which they had held up as an offering to Him; without an order
                    from Him for so doing. But He wondered at them; and accepted their offerings.</p>

                <p>2 And God sent from His presence a bright fire, that consumed their offering.</p>

                <p>3 He smelled the sweet savor of their offering, and showed them mercy.</p>

                <p>4 Then came the Word of God to Adam, and said to him, "O Adam, as you have
                    shed your blood, so will I shed My own blood when I become flesh of your
                    descendants; and as you died, O Adam, so also will I die. And as you built an
                    altar, so also will I make for you an altar of the earth; and as you offered your
                    blood on it, so also will I offer My blood on an altar on the earth.</p>

                <p>5 And as you sued for forgiveness through that blood, so also will I make My
                    blood forgiveness of sins, and erase transgressions in it.</p>

                <p>6 And now, behold, I have accepted your offering, O Adam, but the days of the
                    covenant in which I have bound you are not fulfilled. When they are fulfilled,
                    then will I bring you back into the garden.</p>

                <p>7 Now, therefore, strengthen your heart; and when sorrow comes over you,
                    make Me an offering, and I will be favorable to you."</p>
                
                
                <P>
                    <H2 id="25">Chapter 25</H2>
                    <h3>God represented as merciful and loving. The
                        establishing of worship.</h3>
                </P>   

                <p>1 But God knew that Adam believed he should frequently kill himself and make
                    an offering to Him of his blood.</p>

                <p>2 Therefore He said to him, "O Adam, don't ever kill yourself like this again, by
                    throwing yourself down from that mountain."</p>

                <p>3 But Adam said to God, "I was thinking to put an end to myself at once, for
                    having transgressed Your commandments, and for my having come out of the
                    beautiful garden; and for the bright light of which You have deprived me; and
                    for the praises which poured forth from my mouth without ceasing, and for the
                    light that covered me.</p>

                <p>4 Yet of Your goodness, O God, do not get rid of me altogether; but be
                    favorable to me every time I die, and bring me to life.</p>

                <p>5 And thereby it will be made known that You are a merciful God, who does not
                    want anyone to perish; who loves not that one should fall; and who does not
                    condemn any one cruelly, badly, and by whole destruction."</p>

                <p>6 Then Adam remained silent.</p>

                <p>7 And the Word of God came to him, and blessed him, and comforted him, and
                    covenanted with him, that He would save him at the end of the days
                    determined for him.</p>

                <p>8 This, then, was the first offering Adam made to God; and so it became his
                    custom to do.</p>

                <P>
                    <H2 id="26">Chapter 26</H2>
                    <h3>A beautiful prophecy of eternal life and joy (v. 15). The
                        fall of night.</h3>
                </P>   

                <p>1 Then Adam took Eve, and they began to return to the Cave of Treasures
                    where they lived. But when they got closer to it and saw it from a distance,
                    heavy sorrow fell on Adam and Eve when they looked at it.</p>

                <p>2 Then Adam said to Eve, "When we were on the mountain we were comforted
                    by the Word of God that conversed with us; and the light that came from the
                    east shown over us.</p>

                <p>3 But now the Word of God is hidden from us; and the light that shown over us
                    is so changed as to disappear, and let darkness and sorrow come over us.</p>

                <p>4 And we are forced to enter this cave which is like a prison, in which darkness
                    covers us, so that we are separated from each other; and you can not see me,
                    neither can I see you."</p>

                <p>5 When Adam had said these words, they cried and spread their hands before
                    God; for they were full of sorrow.</p>

                <p>6 And they prayed to God to bring the sun to them, to shine on them, so that
                    darkness would not return to them, and that they wouldn't have to go under
                    this covering of rock. And they wished to die rather than see the darkness.</p>

                <p>7 Then God looked at Adam and Eve and at their great sorrow, and at all they
                    had done with a fervent heart, on account of all the trouble they were in,
                    instead of their former well-being, and on account of all the misery that came
                    over them in a strange land.</p>

                <p>8 Therefore God was not angry with them; nor impatient with them; but he was
                    patient and forbearing towards them, as towards the children He had created.</p>

                <p>9 Then came the Word of God to Adam, and said to him, "Adam, as for the sun,
                    if I were to take it and bring it to you, days, hours, years and months would all
                    stop, and the covenant I have made with you, would never be fulfilled.</p>

                <p>10 But then you would be deserted and stuck in a perpetual plague, and you
                    would never be saved.</p>

                <p>11 Yes, rather, bear long and calm your soul while you live night and day; until
                    the fulfillment of the days, and the time of My covenant is come.</p>

                <p>12 Then shall I come and save you, O Adam, for I do not wish that you be
                    afflicted.</p>

                <p>13 And when I look at all the good things in which you lived, and why you came
                    out of them, then would I willingly show you mercy.</p>

                <p>
                    14 But I cannot alter the covenant that has gone out of My mouth; otherwise I
                    would have brought you back into the garden.</p>

                <p>15 When, however, the covenant is fulfilled, then shall I show you and your
                    descendants mercy, and bring you into a land of gladness, where there is
                    neither sorrow nor suffering; but abiding joy and gladness, and light that never
                    fails, and praises that never cease; and a beautiful garden that shall never
                    pass away."</p>

                <p>16 And God said again to Adam, "Be patient and enter the cave, for the
                    darkness, of which you were afraid, shall only be twelve hours long; and when
                    ended, light shall come up."</p>

                <p>17 Then when Adam heard these words from God, he and Eve worshipped
                    before Him, and their hearts were comforted. They returned into the cave after
                    their custom, while tears flowed from their eyes, sorrow and wailing came from
                    their hearts, and they wished their soul would leave their body.</p>

                <p>18 And Adam and Eve stood praying until the darkness of night came over
                    them, and Adam was hid from Eve, and she from him.</p>

                <p>19 And they remained standing in prayer.</p>

                <P>
                    <H2 id="27">Chapter 27</H2>
                    <h3>The second tempting of Adam and Eve. The devil takes
                        on the form of a beguiling light.</h3>
                </P>   

                <p>1 When Satan, the hater of all good, saw how they continued in prayer, and
                    how God communed with them, and comforted them, and how He had
                    accepted their offering—Satan made an apparition.</p>

                <p> 2 He began with transforming his hosts; in his hands was a flashing fire, and
                    they were in a great light.</p>

                <p>3 He then placed his throne near the mouth of the cave because he could not
                    enter into it by reason of their prayers. And he shed light into the cave, until
                    the cave glistened over Adam and Eve; while his hosts began to sing praises.</p>

                <p>4 And Satan did this, in order that when Adam saw the light, he should think
                    within himself that it was a heavenly light, and that Satan's hosts were angels;
                    and that God had sent them to watch at the cave, and to give him light in the
                    darkness.</p>

                <p>5 So that when Adam came out of the cave and saw them, and Adam and Eve
                    bowed to Satan, then he would overcome Adam thereby, and a second time
                    humble him before God.</p>

                <p>6 When, therefore, Adam and Eve saw the light, fancying it was real, they
                    strengthened their hearts; yet, as they were trembling, Adam said to Eve:—</p>

                <p>7 "Look at that great light, and at those many songs of praise, and at that host
                    standing outside who won't come into our cave. Why don't they tell us what
                    they want, where they are from, what the meaning of this light is, what those
                    praises are, why they have been sent to this place, and why they won't come
                    in?</p>

                <p>8 If they were from God, they would come into the cave with us, and would tell
                    us why they were sent."</p>

                <p>9 Then Adam stood up and prayed to God with a burning heart, and said:—
                    10 "O Lord, is there in the world another god besides You, who created angels
                    and filled them with light, and sent them to keep us, who would come with
                    them?</p>

                <p>11 But, look, we see these hosts that stand at the mouth of the cave; they are
                    in a great light; they sing loud praises. If they are of some other god than You,
                    tell me; and if they are sent by you, inform me of the reason for which You
                    have sent them."</p>

                <p>12 No sooner had Adam said this, than an angel from God appeared to him in
                    the cave, who said to him, "O Adam, fear not. This is Satan and his hosts; he
                    wishes to deceive you as he deceived you at first. For the first time, he was
                    hidden in the serpent; but this time he is come to you in the likeness of an
                    angel of light; in order that, when you worshipped him, he might enslave you,
                    in the very presence of God."</p>

                <p>13 Then the angel went from Adam and seized Satan at the opening of the
                    cave, and stripped him of the pretense he had assumed, and brought him in
                    his own hideous form to Adam and Eve; who were afraid of him when they saw
                    him.</p>

                <p>14 And the angel said to Adam, "This hideous form has been his ever since God
                    made him fall from heaven. He could not have come near you in it; he
                    therefore transformed himself into an angel of light."</p>

                <p>15 Then the angel drove away Satan and his hosts from Adam and Eve, and
                    said to them, "Fear not; God who created you, will strengthen you."
                    16 And the angel left them.</p>

                <p>17 But Adam and Eve remained standing in the cave; no consolation came to
                    them; they divided in their thoughts.</p>

                <p>18 And when it was morning they prayed; and then went out to seek the
                    garden. For their hearts were towards it, and they could get no consolation for
                    having left it.</p>

                    <h3>The Devil pretends to lead Adam and Eve to the water
                        to bathe.</h3>
                </P>   

                <p>1 But when the crafty Satan saw them, that they were going to the garden, he
                    gathered together his host, and came in appearance on a cloud, intent on
                    deceiving them.</p>

                <p>2 But when Adam and Eve saw him thus in a vision, they thought they were
                    angels of God come to comfort them about having left the garden, or to bring
                    them back again into it.</p>

                <p>3 And Adam spread his hands before God, beseeching Him to make him
                    understand what they were.</p>

                <p>4 Then Satan, the hater of all good, said to Adam, "O Adam, I am an angel of
                    the great God; and, behold the hosts that surround me.</p>

                <p>5 God has sent us to take you and bring you to the border of the garden
                    northwards; to the shore of the clear sea, and bathe you and Eve in it, and
                    raise you to your former gladness, that you return again to the garden."</p>

                <p>6 These words sank into the heart of Adam and Eve.</p>

                <p>7 Yet God withheld His Word from Adam, and did not make him understand at
                    once, but waited to see his strength; whether he would be overcome as Eve
                    was when in the garden, or whether he would prevail.</p>

                <p>8 Then Satan called to Adam and Eve, and said, "Behold, we go to the sea of
                    water," and they began to go.</p>

                <p>9 And Adam and Eve followed them at some little distance.</p>

                <p>10 But when they came to the mountain to the north of the garden, a very high
                    mountain, without any steps to the top of it, the Devil drew near to Adam and
                    Eve, and made them go up to the top in reality, and not in a vision; wishing, as
                    he did, to throw them down and kill them, and to wipe off their name from the
                    earth; so that this earth should remain to him and his hosts alone.</p>

                    <h3>God tells Adam of the Devil's purpose. (v. 4).</h3>
                </P>   

                <p>1 But when the merciful God saw that Satan wished to kill Adam with his many
                    tricks, and saw that Adam was meek and without guile, God spoke to Satan in
                    a loud voice, and cursed him.</p>

                <p>2 Then he and his hosts fled, and Adam and Eve remained standing on the top
                    of the mountain, from there they saw below them the wide world, high above
                    which they were. But they saw none of the host which time after time were by
                    them.</p>

                <p>3 They cried, both Adam and Eve, before God, and begged for forgiveness of
                    Him.</p>

                <p>4 Then came the Word from God to Adam, and said to him, "Know you and
                    understand concerning this Satan, that he seeks to deceive you and your
                    descendants after you."</p>

                <p> 5 And Adam cried before the Lord God, and begged and prayed to Him to give
                    him something from the garden, as a token to him, wherein to be comforted.</p>

                <p>6 And God considered Adam's thought, and sent the angel Michael as far as
                    the sea that reaches India, to take from there golden rods and bring them to
                    Adam.</p>

                <p>7 This did God in His wisdom in order that these golden rods, being with Adam
                    in the cave, should shine forth with light in the night around him, and put an
                    end to his fear of the darkness.</p>

                <p>8 Then the angel Michael went down by God's order, took golden rods, as God
                    had commanded him, and brought them to God.</p>

                <p>1 After these things, God commanded the angel Gabriel to go down to the
                    garden, and say to the cherub who kept it, "Behold, God has commanded me
                    to come into the garden, and to take from it sweet smelling incense, and give it
                    to Adam."</p>

                <p>2 Then the angel Gabriel went down by God's order to the garden, and told the
                    cherub as God had commanded him.</p>

                <p>3 The cherub then said, "Well." And Gabriel went in and took the incense.</p>

                <p>4 Then God commanded his angel Raphael to go down to the garden, and
                    speak to the cherub about some myrrh, to give to Adam.</p>

                <p>5 And the angel Raphael went down and told the cherub as God had
                    commanded him, and the cherub said, "Well." Then Raphael went in and took
                    the myrrh.</p>

                <p>6 The golden rods were from the Indian sea, where there are precious stones. 
                    The incense was from the eastern border of the garden; and the myrrh from
                    the western border, from where bitterness came over Adam.</p>

                <p>7 And the angels brought these things to God, by the Tree of Life, in the
                    garden.</p>

                <p>8 Then God said to the angels, "Dip them in the spring of water; then take
                    them and sprinkle their water over Adam and Eve, that they be a little
                    comforted in their sorrow, and give them to Adam and Eve.</p>

                <p>9 And the angels did as God had commanded them, and they gave all those
                    things to Adam and Eve on the top of the mountain on which Satan had placed
                    them, when he sought to make an end of them.</p>

                <p>10 And when Adam saw the golden rods, the incense and the myrrh, he was
                    rejoiced and cried because he thought that the gold was a token of the
                    kingdom from where he had come, that the incense was a token of the bright
                    light which had been taken from him, and that the myrrh was a token of the
                    sorrow in which he was. </p>

                </P> 
     
                <p>1 After these things God said to Adam, "You asked Me for something from the
                    garden, to be comforted therewith, and I have given you these three tokens as
                    a consolation to you; that you trust in Me and in My covenant with you.</p>

                <p>2 For I will come and save you; and kings shall bring me when in the flesh,
                    gold, incense and myrrh; gold as a token of My kingdom; incense as a token of
                    My divinity; and myrrh as a token of My suffering and of My death.</p>

                <p>3 But, O Adam, put these by you in the cave; the gold that it may shed light
                    over you by night; the incense, that you smell its sweet savor; and the myrrh,
                    to comfort you in your sorrow."</p>

                <p>4 When Adam heard these words from God, he worshipped before Him. He and
                    Eve worshipped Him and gave Him thanks, because He had dealt mercifully
                    with them.</p>

                <p>5 Then God commanded the three angels, Michael, Gabriel and Raphael, each
                    to bring what he had brought, and give it to Adam. And they did so, one by
                    one.</p>

                <p>6 And God commanded Suriyel and Salathiel to bear up Adam and Eve, and
                    bring them down from the top of the high mountain, and to take them to the
                    Cave of Treasures.</p>

                <p>7 There they laid the gold on the south side of the cave, the incense on the
                    eastern side, and the myrrh on the western side. For the mouth of the cave
                    was on the north side.</p>

                <p>8 The angels then comforted Adam and Eve, and departed.</p>

                <p>9 The gold was seventy rods*; the incense, twelve pounds; and the myrrh,
                    three pounds.</p>

                <p>10 These remained by Adam in the Cave of Treasures**.</p>

                <p>11 God gave these three things to Adam on the third day after he had come
                    out of the garden, in token of the three days the Lord should remain in the
                    heart of the earth.</p>

                <p>12 And these three things, as they continued with Adam in the cave, gave him
                    light by night; and by day they gave him a little relief from his sorrow.</p>

                <p>* A rod is a unit of linear measure equivalent to 5.5 yards and also a unit of area measure
                    equivalent to 30.25 square yards. In this case, the word rod simply means a kind of long, thin
                    piece of gold of unspecified size and weight.</p>

                    they neither ate of the fruit the earth, nor drank water.</p>

                <p>2 And when it dawned on the eighth day, Adam said to Eve, "O Eve, we prayed
                    God to give us something from the garden, and He sent his angels who brought
                    us what we had desired.</p>

                <p>3 But now, get up, let us go to the sea of water we saw at first, and let us stand
                    in it, praying that God will again be favorable to us and take us back to the
                    garden; or give us something; or that He will give us comfort in some other
                    land than this in which we are."</p>

                <p>4 Then Adam and Eve came out of the cave, went and stood on the border of
                    the sea in which they had before thrown themselves, and Adam said to Eve:—</p>

                <p>5 Come, go down into this place, and come not out of it until the end of thirty
                    days, when I shall come to you. And pray to God with burning heart and a
                    sweet voice, to forgive us.</p>

                <p>6 And I will go to another place, and go down into it, and do like you."</p>

                <p>7 Then Eve went down into the water, as Adam had commanded her. Adam
                    also went down into the water; and they stood praying; and besought the Lord
                    to forgive them their offense, and to restore them to their former state.</p>

                <p>8 And they stood like that praying, until the end of the thirty-five days.</p>

                </P> 

                <p>1 But Satan, the hater of all good, sought them in the cave, but found them
                    not, although he searched diligently for them.</p>

                <p>2 But he found them standing in the water praying and thought within himself,
                "Adam and Eve are standing like that in that water praying to God to forgive
                them their transgression, and to restore them to their former state, and to take
                them from under my hand.</p>

                <p>3 But I will deceive them so that they shall come out of the water, and not fulfil
                    their vow."</p>

                <p>4 Then the hater of all good, went not to Adam, but he went to Eve, and took
                    the form of an angel of God, praising and rejoicing, and said to her:—</p>

                <p>5 "Peace be to you! Be glad and rejoice! God is favorable to you, and He sent
                    me to Adam. I have brought him the glad tidings of salvation, and of his being
                    filled with bright light as he was at first.</p>

                <p>6 And Adam, in his joy for his restoration, has sent me to you, that you come to
                    me, in order that I crown you with light like him.</p>

                <p>7 And he said to me, 'Speak to Eve; if she does not come with you, tell her of
                    the sign when we were on the top of the mountain; how God sent his angels
                    who took us and brought us to the Cave of Treasures; and laid the gold on the
                    southern side; incense, on the eastern side; and myrrh on the western side.'
                    Now come to him."</p>

                <p>8 When Eve hear these words from him, she rejoiced greatly. And thinking
                    Satan's appearance was real, she came out of the sea.</p>

                <p>9 He went before, and she followed him until they came to Adam. Then Satan
                    hid himself from her, and she saw him no more.</p>

                <p>10 She then came and stood before Adam, who was standing by the water and
                    rejoicing in God's forgiveness.</p>

                <p>11 And as she called to him, he turned around, found her there and cried when
                    he saw her, and beat his chest; and from the bitterness of his grief, he sank
                    into the water.</p>

                <p>12 But God looked at him and at his misery, and at his being about to breathe
                    his last. And the Word of God came from heaven, raised him out of the water,
                    and said to him, "Go up the high bank to Eve." And when he came up to Eve he
                    said to her, "Who told you to come here?"</p>

                <p>13 Then she told him the discourse of the angel who had appeared to her and
                    had given her a sign.</p>

                <p>14 But Adam grieved, and gave her to know it was Satan. He then took her and
                    they both returned to the cave.</p>

                <p>15 These things happened to them the second time they went down to the
                    water, seven days after their coming out of the garden.</p>

                <p>16 They fasted in the water thirty-five days; altogether forty-two days since
                    they had left the garden.</p>
                
                <P>

                    <h3>Adam recalls the creation of Eve. He eloquently
                        appeals for food and drink.</h3>
                </P> 

                <p>1 And on the morning of the forty-third day, they came out of the cave,
                    sorrowful and crying. Their bodies were lean, and they were parched from
                    hunger and thirst, from fasting and praying, and from their heavy sorrow on
                    account of their transgression.</p>

                <p>2 And when they had come out of the cave they went up the mountain to the
                    west of the garden.</p>

                <p>3 There they stood and prayed and besought God to grant them forgiveness of
                    their sins.</p>

                <p>4 And after their prayers Adam began to beg God, saying, "O my Lord, my God,
                    and my Creator, You commanded the four elements* to be gathered together,
                    and they were gathered together by Thine order.</p>

                <p>5 Then You spread Your hand and created me out of one element, that of dust
                    of the earth; and You brought me into the garden at the third hour, on a Friday,
                    and informed me of it in the cave.</p>

                <p>6 Then, at first, I knew neither night nor day, for I had a bright nature; neither
                    did the light in which I lived ever leave me to know night or day.</p>

                <p>7 Then, again, O Lord, in that third hour in which You created me, You brought
                    to me all beasts, and lions, and ostriches, and fowls of the air, and all things
                    that move in the earth, which You had created at the first hour before me of
                    the Friday.</p>

                <p>8 And Your will was that I should name them all, one by one, with a suitable
                    name. But You gave me understanding and knowledge, and a pure heart and a
                    right mind from you, that I should name them after Thine own mind regarding
                    the naming of them.</p>

                <p>9 O God, You made them obedient to me, and ordered that not one of them
                    break from my sway, according to Your commandment, and to the dominion
                    which You had given me over them. But now they are all estranged from me.</p>

                <p>10 Then it was in that third hour of Friday, in which You created me, and
                    commanded me concerning the tree, to which I was neither to go near, nor to
                    eat thereof; for You said to me in the garden, 'When you eat of it, of death you
                    shall die.'</p>

                <p>11 And if You had punished me as You said, with death, I should have died that
                    very moment.</p>

                <p>12 Moreover, when You commanded me regarding the tree, I was neither to
                    approach nor to eat thereof, Eve was not with me; You had not yet created her,
                    neither had You yet taken her out of my side; nor had she yet heard this order
                    from you.</p>

                <p>13 Then, at the end of the third hour of that Friday, O Lord, You caused a
                    slumber and a sleep to come over me, and I slept, and was overwhelmed in
                    sleep.</p>

                <p>14 Then You drew a rib out of my side, and created it after my own likeness
                    and image. Then I awoke; and when I saw her and knew who she was, I said,
                    'This is bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh; from now on she shall be
                    called woman.'</p>

                <p>15 It was of Your good will, O God, that You brought a slumber in a sleep over
                    me, and that You immediately brought Eve out of my side, until she was out, so
                    that I did not see how she was made; neither could I witness, O my Lord, how
                    awful and great are Your goodness and glory.</p>

                <p>16 And of Your goodwill, O Lord, You made us both with bodies of a bright
                    nature, and You made us two, one; and You gave us Your grace, and filled us
                    with praises of the Holy Spirit; that we should be neither hungry nor thirsty, nor
                    know what sorrow is, nor yet faintness of heart; neither suffering, fasting nor
                    weariness.</p>

                <p>17 But now, O God, since we transgressed Your commandment and broke Your
                    law, You have brought us out into a strange land, and have caused suffering,
                    and faintness, hunger and thirst to come over us.</p>

                <p>18 Now, therefore, O God, we pray you, give us something to eat from the
                    garden, to satisfy our hunger with it; and something wherewith to quench our
                    thirst.</p>

                <p>19 For, behold, many days, O God, we have tasted nothing and drunk nothing,
                    and our flesh is dried up, and our strength is wasted, and sleep is gone from
                    our eyes from faintness and crying.</p>

                <p>20 Then, O God, we dare not gather anything from the fruit of trees, from fear
                    of you. For when we transgress at first You spared us and did not make us die.</p>

                <p>21 But now, we thought in our hearts, if we eat of the fruit of the trees, without
                    God's order, He will destroy us this time, and will wipe us off from the face of
                    the earth.</p>

                <p>22 And if we drink of this water, without God's order, He will make an end of us
                    and root us up at once.</p>

                <p>23 Now, therefore, O God, that I am come to this place with Eve, we beg You to
                    give us some fruit from the garden, that we may be satisfied with it.</p>

                <p>24 For we desire the fruit that is on the earth, and all else that we lack in it."</p>

                <p>* The medieval belief that there were only four elements—fire, earth, air, and water—was
                    widely accepted until about 1500 AD when the current atomic theory was in its infancy.</p>

                </P> 

                <p>1 Then God looked again at Adam and his crying and groaning, and the Word
                    of God came to him, and said to him:—</p>

                <p>2 "O Adam, when you were in My garden, you knew neither eating nor
                    drinking; neither faintness nor suffering; neither leanness of flesh, nor change;
                    neither did sleep depart from thine eyes. But since you transgressed, and
                    came into this strange land, all these trials are come over you."</p>

                    <H2 id="36">Chapter 36</H2>
                    <h3>Figs.</h3>
                </P> 

                <p>1 Then God commanded the cherub, who kept the gate of the garden with a
                    sword of fire in his hand, to take some of the fruit of the fig-tree, and to give it
                    to Adam.</p>

                <p>2 The cherub obeyed the command of the Lord God, and went into the garden
                    and brought two figs on two twigs, each fig hanging to its leaf; they were from
                    two of the trees among which Adam and Eve hid themselves when God went to
                    walk in the garden, and the Word of God came to Adam and Eve and said to
                    them, "Adam, Adam, where are you?"</p>

                <p>3 And Adam answered, "O God, here I am. When I heard the sound of You and
                    Your voice, I hid myself, because I am naked."</p>

                <p>4 Then the cherub took two figs and brought them to Adam and Eve. But he
                    threw them to them from a distance; for they might not come near the cherub
                    by reason of their flesh, that could not come near the fire.</p>

                <p>5 At first, angels trembled at the presence of Adam and were afraid of him. But
                    now Adam trembled before the angels and was afraid of them.</p>

                <p>6 Then Adam came closer and took one fig, and Eve also came in turn and took
                    the other.</p>

                <p>7 And as they took them up in their hands, they looked at them, and knew they
                    were from the trees among which they had hidden themselves.</p>

                </P> 

                <p>1 Then Adam said to Eve, "Do you not see these figs and their leaves, with
                    which we covered ourselves when we were stripped of our bright nature? But
                    now, we do not know what misery and suffering may come over us from eating
                    them.</p>

                <p>2 Now, therefore, O Eve, let us restrain ourselves and not eat of them, you and
                    I; and let us ask God to give us of the fruit of the Tree of Life."</p>

                <p>3 Thus did Adam and Eve restrain themselves, and did not eat of these figs.</p>

                <p>4 But Adam began to pray to God and to beseech Him to give him of the fruit
                    of the Tree of Life, saying thus: "O God, when we transgressed Your
                    commandment at the sixth hour of Friday, we were stripped of the bright
                    nature we had, and did not continue in the garden after our transgression,
                    more than three hours.</p>

                <p>5 But in the evening You made us come out of it. O God, we transgressed
                    against You one hour, and all these trials and sorrows have come over us until
                    this day.</p>

                <p>6 And those days together with this the forty-third day, do not redeem that one
                    hour in which we transgressed!</p>

                <p>7 O God, look at us with an eye of pity, and do not avenge us according to our
                    transgression of Your commandment, in Your presence.</p>

                <p>8 O God, give us of the fruit of the Tree of Life, that we may eat of it, and live,
                    and turn not to see sufferings and other trouble, in this earth; for You are God.</p>

                <p>9 When we transgressed Your commandment, You made us come out of the
                    garden, and sent a cherub to keep the Tree of Life, lest we should eat thereof,
                    and live; and know nothing of faintness after we transgressed.</p>

                <p>10 But now, O Lord, behold, we have endured all these days, and have borne
                    sufferings. Make these forty-three days an equivalent for the one hour in which
                    we transgressed."</p>

                </P> 

                <p>1 After these things the Word of God came to Adam, and said to him:—</p>

                <p>2 "O Adam, as to the fruit on the Tree of Life that you have asked for, I will not
                    give it to you now, but only when the 5500 years are fulfilled. At that time I will
                    give you fruit from the Tree of Life, and you will eat, and live forever, you, and
                    Eve, and your righteous descendants.</p>

                <p>3 But these forty-three days cannot make amends for the hour in which you
                    transgressed My commandment.</p>

                <p>4 O Adam, I gave you the fruit of the fig-tree to eat in which you hid yourself.
                    Go and eat of it, you and Eve.</p>

                <p>5 I will not deny your request, neither will I disappoint your hope; therefore,
                    endure until the fulfillment of the covenant I made with you."</p>

                <p>6 And God withdrew His Word from Adam.</p>

                    yourself, and I will take another; and let us go to our cave."</p>

                <p>2 Then Adam and Eve took each a fig and went towards the cave; the time was
                    about the setting of the sun; and their thoughts made them long to eat of the
                    fruit.</p>

                <p>3 But Adam said to Eve, "I am afraid to eat of this fig. I know not what may
                    come over me from it."</p>

                <p>4 So Adam cried, and stood praying before God, saying, "Satisfy my hunger,
                    without my having to eat this fig; for after I have eaten it, what will it profit
                    me? And what shall I desire and ask of you, O God, when it is gone?"</p>

                <p>5 And he said again, "I am afraid to eat of it; for I know not what will befall me
                    through it."</p>

                    <h3>The first Human hunger.</h3>
                </P> 

                <p>1 Then the Word of God came to Adam, and said to him, "O Adam, why didn't
                    you have this dread, or this fasting, or this care before now? And why didn't
                    you have this fear before you transgressed?</p>

                <p>2 But when you came to live in this strange land, your animal body could not
                survive on earth without earthly food, to strengthen it and to restore its
                powers."</p>

                <p>3 And God withdrew His Word for Adam.</p>

                    <h3>The first Human thirst.</h3>
                </P> 

                <p>1 Then Adam took the fig, and laid it on the golden rods. Eve also took her fig,
                    and put it on the incense.</p>
                    
                <p>2 And the weight of each fig was that of a water-melon; for the fruit of the
                    garden was much larger than the fruit of this land*.</p>

                <p>3 But Adam and Eve remained standing and fasting the whole of that night,
                    until the morning dawned.</p>

                <p>4 When the sun rose they were still praying, but after they had finished
                    praying, Adam said to Eve:—</p>

                <p>5 "O Eve, come, let us go to the border of the garden looking south; to the
                    place from where the river flows, and is parted into four heads. There we will
                    pray to God, and ask Him to give us some of the Water of Life to drink.</p>

                <p>6 For God has not fed us with the Tree of Life, in order that we may not live.
                    Therefore, we will ask him to give us some of the Water of Life, and to quench
                    our thirst with it, rather than with a drink of water of this land."</p>

                <p>7 When Eve heard these words from Adam, she agreed; and they both got up
                    and came to the southern border of the garden, at the edge of the river of
                    water a short distance from the garden.</p>

                <p>8 And they stood and prayed before the Lord, and asked Him to look at them
                    this once, to forgive them, and to grant them their request.</p>

                <p>9 After this prayer from both of them, Adam began to pray with his voice
                    before God, and said;—</p>

                <p>10 "O Lord, when I was in the garden and saw the water that flowed from
                    under the Tree of Life, my heart did not desire, neither did my body require to
                    drink of it; neither did I know thirst, for I was living; and above that which I am
                    now.</p>

                <p>11 So that in order to live I did not require any Food of Life, neither did I drink
                    of the Water of Life.</p>

                <p>12 But now, O God, I am dead; my flesh is parched with thirst. Give me of the
                    Water of Life that I may drink of it and live.</p>

                <p>13 Of Your mercy, O God, save me from these plagues and trials, and bring me
                    into another land different from this, if You will not let me live in Your garden."</p>

                <p>* This is substantiated by Genesis 3:7 whereby the leaves of the fig tree were large enough
                    that Adam and Eve could fashion garments from them.</p>

                        the coming of Christ.</h3>
                </P> 

                <p> 1 Then came the Word of God to Adam, and said to him:—</p>

                <p>2 "O Adam, as to what you said, 'Bring me into a land where there is rest,' it is
                    not another land than this, but it is the kingdom of heaven where alone there is
                    rest.</p>

                <p>3 But you can not make your entrance into it at present; but only after your
                    judgment is past and fulfilled.</p>

                <p>4 Then will I make you go up into the kingdom of heaven, you and your
                    righteous descendants; and I will give you and them the rest you ask for at
                    present.</p>

                <p>5 And if you said, 'Give me of the Water of Life that I may drink and live'—it
                    cannot be this day, but on the day that I shall descend into hell, and break the
                    gates of brass, and bruise in pieces the kingdoms of iron.</p>

                <p>6 Then will I in mercy save your soul and the souls of the righteous, to give
                    them rest in My garden. And that shall be when the end of the world is come.</p>

                <p>7 And, again, in regards to the Water of Life you seek, it will not be granted you
                    this day; but on the day that I shall shed My blood on your head* in the land of
                    Golgotha**.</p>

                <p>8 For My blood shall be the Water of Life to you at that time, and not to just
                    you alone, but to all your descendants who shall believe in Me***; that it be to
                    them for rest forever."</p>

                <p>9 The Lord said again to Adam, "O Adam, when you were in the garden, these
                    trials did not come to you.</p>

                <p>10 But since you transgressed My commandment, all these sufferings have
                    come over you.</p>

                <p>11 Now, also, does your flesh require food and drink; drink then of that water
                    that flows by you on the face of the earth.</p>

                <p>12 Then God withdrew His Word from Adam.</p>

                <p>13 And Adam and Eve worshipped the Lord, and returned from the river of
                    water to the cave. It was noon-day; and when they drew near to the cave, they
                    saw a large fire by it.</p>

                <p>* This phrase indicates that the bleeding will take place in an elevated position above the
                    populace. This is believed to be a reference to the cross whereby Christ bled profusely above
                    the people below.</p>

                <p>** Golgotha (goal-goth-uh) was the hill outside the walls of Jerusalem where Jesus was
                    crucified. Its exact location is not precisely known, but the Church of the Holy Sepulcher is
                    believed to have been constructed on this hill.</p>

                    <h3>The Devil attempts arson.</h3>
                </P> 

                <p>1 Then Adam and Eve were afraid, and stood still. And Adam said to Eve, "What
                    is that fire by our cave? We have done nothing in it to cause this fire.</p>

                <p>2 We neither have bread to bake therein, nor broth to cook there. As to this
                    fire, we have never known anything like it, neither do we know what to call it.</p>

                <p>3 But ever since God sent the cherub with a sword of fire that flashed and
                    lightened in his hand, from fear of which we fell down and were like corpses,
                    have we not seen the like.</p>

                <p>4 But now, O Eve, behold, this is the same fire that was in the cherub's hand,
                    which God has sent to keep the cave in which we live.</p>

                <p>5 O Eve, it is because God is angry with us, and will drive us from it.</p>

                <p>6 O Eve, we have again transgressed His commandment in that cave, so that
                    He had sent this fire to burn around it, and to prevent us from going into it.</p>

                <p>7 If this be really so, O Eve, where shall we live? And where shall we flee from
                    before the face of the Lord? Since, in regards to the garden, He will not let us
                    live in it, and He has deprived us of the good things thereof; but He has placed
                    us in this cave, in which we have borne darkness, trials and hardships, until at
                    last we have found comfort therein.</p>

                <p>8 But now that He has brought us out into another land, who knows what may
                    happen in it? And who knows but that the darkness of that land may be far
                    greater than the darkness of this land?</p>

                <p>9 Who knows what may happen in that land by day or by night? And who
                    knows whether it will be far or near, O Eve? Where it will please God to put us,
                    may be far from the garden, O Eve? Or where God will prevent us from
                    beholding Him, because we have transgressed His commandment, and
                    because we have made requests of Him at all times?</p>

                <p>10 O Eve, if God will bring us into a strange land other than this, in which we
                    find consolation, it must be to put our souls to death, and blot out our name
                    from the face of the earth.</p>

                <p>11 O Eve, if we are further alienated from the garden and from God, where
                    shall we find Him again, and ask Him to give us gold, incense, myrrh, and some
                    fruit of the fig-tree?</p>

                <p>12 Where shall we find Him, to comfort us a second time? Where shall we find
                    Him, that He may think of us, as regards the covenant He has made on our
                    behalf?"</p>

                <p>13 Then Adam said no more. And they kept looking, He and Eve, towards the
                    cave, and at the fire that flared up around it.</p>

                <p>14 But that fire was from Satan. For he had gathered trees and dry grasses,
                    and had carried and brought them to the cave, and had set fire to them, in
                    order to consume the cave and what was in it.</p>

                <p>15 So that Adam and Eve should be left in sorrow, and he should cut off their
                    trust in God, and make them deny Him.</p>

                <p>16 But by the mercy of God he could not burn the cave, for God sent His angel
                    around the cave to guard it from such a fire, until it went out.</p>

                <p>17 And this fire lasted from noon-day until the break of day. That was the forty-fifth day.</p>

                <P>
                    <H2 id="44">Chapter 44</H2>
                    <h3>The power of fire over man.</h3>
                </P> 

                <p>1 Yet Adam and Eve were standing and looking at the fire, and unable to come
                    near the cave from their dread of the fire.</p>

                <p>2 And Satan kept on bringing trees and throwing them into the fire, until the
                    flames of the fire rose up on high, and covered the whole cave, thinking, as he
                    did in his own mind, to consume the cave with much fire. But the angel of the
                    Lord was guarding it.</p>

                <p>3 And yet he could not curse Satan, nor injure him by word, because he had no
                    authority over him, neither did he take to doing so with words from his mouth.</p>

                <p>4 Therefore the angel tolerated him, without saying one bad word, until the
                    Word of God came who said to Satan, "Go away from here; once before you
                    deceived My servants, and this time you seek to destroy them.</p>

                <p>5 Were it not for My mercy I would have destroyed you and your hosts from off
                    the earth. But I have had patience with you, until the end of the world."</p>

                <p>6 Then Satan fled from before the Lord. But the fire went on burning around
                    the cave like a coal-fire the whole day; which was the forty-sixth day Adam and
                    Eve had spent since they came out of the garden.</p>

                <p>7 And when Adam and Eve saw that the heat of the fire had somewhat cooled
                    down, they began to walk towards the cave to get into it as they usually did;
                    but they could not, by reason of the heat of the fire.</p>

                <p>8 Then they both began crying because of the fire that separated them from
                    the cave, and that came towards them, burning. And they were afraid.</p>

                <p>9 Then Adam said to Eve, "See this fire of which we have a portion in us: which
                    formerly yielded to us, but no longer does so, now that we have transgressed
                    the limit of creation, and changed our condition, and our nature is altered. But
                    the fire is not changed in its nature, nor altered from its creation. Therefore it
                    now has power over us; and when we come near it, it scorches our flesh."</p>

                    <H2 id="45">Chapter 45</H2>
                    <h3>Why Satan didn't fulfil his promises. Description of hell.</h3>
                </P> 
                
                <p>1 Then Adam rose and prayed to God, saying, "See, this fire has separated us
                    from the cave in which You have commanded us to live; but now, behold, we
                    cannot go into it."</p>

                <p>2 Then God heard Adam, and sent him His Word, that said:—</p>

                <p>3 "O Adam, see this fire! How different the flame and heat thereof are from the
                    garden of delights and the good things in it!</p>

                <p>4 When you were under My control, all creatures yielded to you; but after you
                    have transgressed My commandment, they all rise over you."</p>

                <p>5 God said again to him, "See, O Adam, how Satan has exalted you! He has
                    deprived you of the Godhead, and of an exalted state like Me, and has not kept
                    his word to you; but has, after all, become your enemy. He is the one who
                    made this fire in which he meant to burn you and Eve.</p>

                <p>6 Why, O Adam, has he not kept his agreement with you, not even one day;
                    but has deprived you of the glory that was on you—when you yielded to his
                    command?</p>

                <p>7 Do you think, Adam, that he loved you when he made this agreement with
                    you? Or that he loved you and wished to raise you on high?</p>

                <p>8 But no, Adam, he did not do all that out of love to you; but he wished to
                    make you come out of light into darkness; and from an exalted state to
                    degradation; from glory to abasement; from joy to sorrow; and from rest to
                    fasting and fainting."</p>

                <p>9 God also said to Adam, "See this fire kindled by Satan around your cave; see
                    this wonder that surrounds you; and know that it will encompass about both
                    you and your descendants, when you obey his command; that he will plague
                    you with fire; and that you will go down into hell after you are dead.</p>

                <p>10 Then you will see the burning of his fire, that will be burning around you and
                    likewise your descendants. You will not be delivered from it until My coming;
                    just like you cannot go into your cave right now because of the great fire
                    around it; not until My Word comes and makes a way for you on the day My
                    covenant is fulfilled.</p>

                <p>11 There is no way for you at present to come from this life to rest, not until My
                    Word comes, who is My Word. Then He will make a way for you, and you shall
                    have rest." Then God called with His Word to the fire that burned around the
                    cave, that it split itself in half, until Adam had gone through it. Then the fire
                    parted itself by God's order, and a way was made for Adam*.</p>

                <p>12 And God withdrew His Word from Adam.</p>

                        15 Now the Jordan is at flood stage all during harvest. Yet as soon as the priests who carried the ark reached the Jordan and their feet touched the water’s edge, 16 the water from upstream stopped flowing. It piled up in a heap a great distance away, at a town called Adam in the vicinity of Zarethan, while the water flowing down to the Sea of the Arabah (that is, the Dead Sea) was completely cut off. So the people crossed over opposite Jericho.

                    <h3>"How many times have I delivered you out of his hand..."</h3>
                </P> 

                <p>1 Then Adam and Eve began again to come into the cave. And when they came
                    to the way between the fire, Satan blew into the fire like a whirlwind, and
                    caused the burning coal-fire to cover Adam and Eve; so that their bodies were
                    singed; and the coal-fire scorched them*.</p>

                <p>2 And from the burning of the fire Adam and Eve screamed, and said, "O Lord,
                    save us! Leave us not to be consumed and plagued by this burning fire; neither
                    require us for having transgressed Your commandment."</p>

                <p>3 Then God looked at their bodies, on which Satan had caused fire to burn, and
                    God sent His angel that stayed the burning fire. But the wounds remained on
                    their bodies.</p>

                <p>4 And God said to Adam, "See Satan's love for you, who pretended to give you
                    the Godhead and greatness; and, behold, he burns you with fire, and seeks to
                    destroy you from off the earth.</p>

                <p>5 Then look at Me, O Adam; I created you, and how many times have I
                    delivered you out of his hand? If not, wouldn't he have destroyed you?"</p>

                <p>6 God said again to Eve, "What is that he promised you in the garden, saying,
                    'As soon as you eat from the tree, your eyes will be opened, and you shall
                    become like gods, knowing good and evil.' But look! He has burnt your bodies
                    with fire, and has made you taste the taste of fire, for the taste of the garden;
                    and has made you see the burning of fire, and the evil of it, and the power it
                    has over you.</p>

                <p>7 Your eyes have seen the good he has taken from you, and in truth he has
                    opened your eyes; and you have seen the garden in which you were with Me,
                    and you have also seen the evil that has come over you from Satan. But as to
                    the Godhead he cannot give it to you, neither fulfil his speech to you. No, he
                    was bitter against you and your descendants, that will come after you."</p>

                <p>8 And God withdrew His Word form them.</p>

                <p>* At this time, the garments that the Lord had given them in Genesis 3:21 were burned off so
                    that Adam and Eve were again naked. Reference chapter L whereby Adam and Eve seek
                    garments with which to cover their nakedness..</p>

                    <h3>The Devil's own Scheming.</h3>
                </P> 

                <p>1 Then Adam and Eve came into the cave, yet trembling at the fire that had
                    scorched their bodies. So Adam said to Eve:—</p>

                <p>2 "Look, the fire has burnt our flesh in this world; but how will it be when we
                    are dead, and Satan shall punish our souls? Is not our deliverance long and far
                    off, unless God come, and in mercy to us fulfil His promise?"</p>

                <p>3 Then Adam and Eve passed into the cave, blessing themselves for coming
                    into it once more. For it was in their thoughts, that they never should enter it,
                    when they saw the fire around it.</p>

                <p>4 But as the sun was setting the fire was still burning and nearing Adam and
                    Eve in the cave, so that they could not sleep in it. After the sun had set, they
                    went out of it. This was the forty-seventh day after they came out of the
                    garden.</p>

                <p>5 Adam and Eve then came under the top of hill by the garden to sleep, as
                    they were accustomed.</p>

                <p>6 And they stood and prayed God to forgive them their sins, and then fell
                    asleep under the summit of the mountain.</p>

                <p>7 But Satan, the hater of all good, thought within himself: "Whereas God has
                    promised salvation to Adam by covenant, and that He would deliver him out of
                    all the hardships that have befallen him—but has not promised me by
                    covenant, and will not deliver me out of my hardships; no, since He has
                    promised him that He should make him and his descendants live in the
                    kingdom in which I once was—I will kill Adam.</p>

                <p>8 The earth shall be rid of him; and shall be left to me alone; so that when he is
                    dead he may not have any descendants left to inherit the kingdom that shall
                    remain my own realm; God will then be wanting me, and He will restore it to
                    me and my hosts."</p>

                <P>
                    <H2 id="48">Chapter 48</H2>
                    <h3>Fifth apparition of Satan to Adam and Eve.</h3>
                </P> 

                <p>1 After this Satan called to his hosts, all of which came to him, and said to him:
                    —</p>

                <p>2 "O, our lord, what will you do?"</p>

                <p>3 He then said to them, "You know that this Adam, whom God created out of
                    the dust, is the one who has taken our kingdom, come, let us gather together
                    and kill him; or hurl a rock at him and at Eve, and crush them under it."</p>

                <p>4 When Satan's hosts heard these words, they came to the part of the
                    mountain where Adam and Eve were asleep.</p>

                <p>5 Then Satan and his host took a huge rock, broad and even, and without
                    blemish, thinking within himself, "If there should be a hole in the rock, when it
                    fell on them, the hole in the rock might come over them, and so they would
                    escape and not die."</p>

                <p>6 He then said to his hosts, "Take up this stone, and throw it flat on them, so
                    that it doesn't roll off them to somewhere else. And when you have hurled it,
                    get away from there quickly."</p>

                <p>7 And they did as he told them. But as the rock fell down from the mountain
                    toward Adam and Eve, God commanded the rock to become a dome over
                    them*, that did them no harm. And so it was by God's order.</p>

                <p>8 But when the rock fell, the whole earth quaked with it**, and was shaken
                    from the size of the rock.</p>

                <p>9 And as it quaked and shook, Adam and Eve awoke from sleep, and found
                    themselves under a dome of rock. But they didn't know what had happened;
                    because when the fell asleep they were under the sky, and not under a dome;
                    and when they saw it, they were afraid.</p>

                <p>10 Then Adam said to Eve, "Wherefore has the mountain bent itself, and the
                    earth quaked and shaken on our account? And why has this rock spread itself
                    over us like a tent?</p>

                <p>11 Does God intend to plague us and to shut us up in this prison? Or will He
                    close the earth over us?</p>

                <p>12 He is angry with us for our having come out of the cave, without His order;
                    and for our having done so of our own accord, without consulting Him, when
                    we left the cave and came to this place."</p>

                <p>13 Then Eve said, "If, indeed, the earth quaked for our sake, and this rock
                    forms a tent over us because of our transgression, then we will be sorry, O
                    Adam, because our punishment will be long.</p>

                <p>14 But get up and pray to God to let us know concerning this, and what this
                    rock is that is spread over us like a tent."</p>

                <p>15 Then Adam stood up and prayed before the Lord, to let him know what had
                    brought about this difficult time. And Adam stood praying like that until the
                    morning.</p>

                <p>* The word "dome" is used here but the text does not specifically suggest that the covering
                    was round—only that it covered them on all sides, however a dome is the most likely shape
                    …
                    that would have be able to withstand the impact with the ground. From verse 9 that says
                    "when they saw it" and verse 11 that says "shut us up in this prison", we can conclude that the
                    dome had holes in its sides that were big enough to let in light and air but were too small to
                    allow Adam and Eve to escape. Another conclusion would be that the holes were large but too
                    high up for Adam and Eve to reach, however the former is more likely.</p>

                <p>** In verse 7 of the next chapter (XLIX), God tells Adam and Eve that the ground was also
                    lowered under them—"I commanded … the rock under you to lower itself".</p>

                    <h3>The first prophecy of the Resurrection.</h3>
                </P> 

                <p>1 Then the Word of God came and said:—</p>

                <p>2 "O Adam, who counselled you, when you came out of the cave, to come to
                    this place?"</p>

                <p>3 And Adam said to God, "O Lord, we came to this place because of the heat of
                    the fire, that came over us inside the cave."</p>

                <p>4 Then the Lord God said to Adam, "O Adam, you dread the heat of fire for one
                    night, but how will it be when you live in hell?</p>

                <p>5 Yet, O Adam, don't be afraid, and don't believe that I have placed this dome
                    of rock over you to plague you with it.</p>

                <p>6 It came from Satan, who had promised you the Godhead and majesty. It is he
                    who threw down this rock to kill you under it, and Eve with you, and thus to
                    prevent you from living on the earth.</p>

                <p>7 But, in mercy for you, just as that rock was falling down on you, I
                    commanded it to form an dome over you; and the rock under you to lower
                    itself.</p>

                <p>8 And this sign, O Adam, will happen to Me at My coming on earth: Satan will
                    raise the people of the Jews to put Me to death; and they will lay Me in a rock,
                    and seal a large stone over Me, and I shall remain within that rock three days
                    and three nights.</p>

                <p>9 But on the third day I shall rise again, and it shall be salvation to you, O
                    Adam, and to your descendants, to believe in Me. But, O Adam, I will not bring
                    you from under this rock until three days and three nights have passed."</p>

                <p>10 And God withdrew His Word from Adam.</p>

                <p>11 But Adam and Eve lived under the rock three days and three nights, as God
                    had told them.</p>

                <p>12 And God did so to them because they had left their cave and had come to
                    this same place without God's order.</p>

                <p>13 But, after three days and three nights, God created an opening in the dome
                    of rock and allowed them to get out from under it. Their flesh was dried up, and
                    their eyes and hearts were troubled from crying and sorrow.</p>

                </P> 

                <p>1 Then Adam and Eve went forth and came into the Cave of Treasures, and
                    they stood praying in it the whole of that day, until the evening.</p>

                <p>2 And this took place at the end of the fifty days after they had left the garden.</p>

                <p>3 But Adam and Eve rose again and prayed to God in the cave the whole of
                    that night, and begged for mercy from Him.</p>

                <p>4 And when the day dawned, Adam said to Eve, "Come! Let us go and do some
                    work for our bodies."</p>

                <p>5 So they went out of the cave, and came to the northern border of the garden,
                    and they looked for something to cover their bodies with*. But they found
                    nothing, and knew not how to do the work. Yet their bodies were stained, and
                    they were speechless from cold and heat.</p>

                <p>6 Then Adam stood and asked God to show him something with which to cover
                    their bodies.</p>

                <p>7 Then came the Word of God and said to him, "O Adam, take Eve and come to
                    the seashore where you fasted before. There you will find skins of sheep that
                    were left after lions ate the carcasses. Take them and make garments for
                    yourselves, and clothe yourselves with them.</p>
                
                <P>
                    * Chapter XLVI, 
                    verse 1, says "Satan blew into the fire ... so that their bodies were singed". At
                    this time, the garments that the Lord had given them in Genesis 3:21 were burned off so that
                    Adam and Eve were again naked.

                </P> 

                <P>1 When Adam heard these words from God, he took Eve and went from the
                    northern end of the garden to the south of it, by the river of water where they
                    once fasted.</P>

                <P>2 But as they were going on their way, and before they got there, Satan, the
                    wicked one, had heard the Word of God communing with Adam respecting his
                    covering.</P>

                <P>3 It grieved him, and he hastened to the place where the sheep-skins were,
                    with the intention of taking them and throwing them into the sea, or of burning
                    them with fire, so that Adam and Eve would not find them.</P>

                <P>4 But as he was about to take them, the Word of God came from heaven, and
                    bound him by the side of those skins until Adam and Eve came near him. But
                    as they got closer to him they were afraid of him, and of his hideous look.</P>

                <P>5 Then came the Word of God to Adam and Eve, and said to them, "This is he
                    who was hidden in the serpent, and who deceived you, and stripped you of the
                    garment of light and glory in which you were.</P>

                <P>6 This is he who promised you majesty and divinity. Where, then, is the beauty
                    that was on him? Where is his divinity? Where is his light? Where is the glory
                    that rested on him?</P>

                <P>7 Now his figure is hideous; he is become abominable among angels; and he
                    has come to be called Satan.</P>

                <P>8 O Adam, he wished to take from you this earthly garment of sheep-skins, and
                    to destroy it, and not let you be covered with it.</P>

                <P>9 What, then, is his beauty that you should have followed him? And what have
                    you gained by obeying him? See his evil works and then look at Me; at Me,
                    your Creator, and at the good deeds I do you.</P>

                <P>10 See, I bound him until you came and saw him and beheld his weakness, that
                    no power is left with him."</P>

                <h3>Adam and Eve sew the first shirt.</h3>
            </P> 

            <P>1 After this Adam and Eve said no more, but cried before God on account of
                their creation, and of their bodies that required an earthly covering.</P>

            <P>2 Then Adam said to Eve, "O Eve, this is the skin of beasts with which we shall
                be covered, but when we put it on, behold, we shall be wearing a token of
                death on our bodies. Just as the owners of these skins have died and have
                wasted away, so also shall we die and pass away."</P>

            <P>3 Then Adam and Eve took the skins, and went back to the Cave of Treasures;
                and when in it, they stood and prayed as they were accustomed.</P>

            <P>4 And they thought how they could make garments of those skins; for they had
                no skill for it.</P>

            <P>5 Then God sent to them His angel to show them how to work it out. And the
                angel said to Adam, "Go forth, and bring some palm-thorns." Then Adam went
                out, and brought some, as the angel had commanded him.</P>

            <P>6 Then the angel began before them to work out the skins, after the manner of
                one who prepares a shirt. And he took the thorns and stuck them into the
                skins, before their eyes.</P>

            <P>7 Then the angel again stood up and prayed God that the thorns in those skins
                should be hidden, so as to be, as it were, sewn with one thread.</P>

            <P>8 And so it was, by God's order; they became garments for Adam and Eve, and
                He clothed them therewith.</P>

            <P>9 From that time the nakedness of their bodies was covered from the sight of
                each other's eyes.</P>

            <P>10 And this happened at the end of the fifty-first day.</P>

            <P>11 Then when Adam's and Eve's bodies were covered, they stood and prayed,
                and sought mercy of the Lord, and forgiveness, and gave Him thanks for that
                He had had mercy on them, and had covered their nakedness. And they
                ceased not from prayer the whole of that night.</P>

            <P>12 Then when the morning dawned at the rising of the sun, they said their
                prayers after their custom; and then went out of the cave.</P>

            <P>13 And Adam said to Eve, "Since we don't know what there is to the west of
                this cave, let us go out and see it today." Then they came forth and went
                toward the western border.</P>

            <P>
                <H2 id="53">Chapter 53</H2>
                <h3>The prophecy of the Western Lands and of the great
                    flood.</h3>
            </P> 

        
            <p>1 They were not very far from the cave, when Satan came towards them, and
                hid himself between them and the cave, under the form of two ravenous lions
                three days without food, that came towards Adam and Eve, as if to break them
                in pieces and devour them.</p>

            <p>2 Then Adam and Eve cried, and prayed God to deliver them from their paws.</p>

            <p>3 Then the Word of God came to them, and drove away the lions from them.</p>

            <p>4 And God said to Adam, "O Adam, what do you seek on the western border?
                And why have you left of thine own accord the eastern border, in which was
                your living place?</p>

            <p>5 Now then, turn back to your cave, and remain in it, so that Satan won't
                deceive you or work his purpose over you.</p>

            <p>6 For in this western border, O Adam, there will go from you a descendant, that
                shall replenish it; and that will defile themselves with their sins, and with their
                yielding to the commands of Satan, and by following his works.</p>

            <p>7 Therefore will I bring over them the waters of a flood, and overwhelm them
                all. But I will deliver what is left of the righteous among them; and I will bring
                them to a distant land, and the land in which you live now shall remain
                desolate and without one inhabitant in it.</p>

            <p>8 After God had thus spoken to them, they went back to the Cave of Treasures.
                But their flesh was dried up, and they were weak from fasting and praying, and
                from the sorrow they felt at having trespassed against God.</p>


            <P>
                <H2 id="54">Chapter 54</H2>
                <h3>Adam and Eve go exploring.</h3>
            </P> 

            <p>1 Then Adam and Eve stood up in the cave and prayed the whole of that night
                until the morning dawned. And when the sun was risen they both went out of
                the cave; their heads were wandering from heaviness of sorrow and they didn't
                know where they were going.</p>

            <p>2 And they walked in that condition to the southern border of the garden. And
                they began to go up that border until they came to the eastern border beyond
                which there was no more land.</p>

            <p>3 And the cherub who guarded the garden was standing at the western gate,
                and guarding it against Adam and Eve, lest they should suddenly come into the
                garden. And the cherub turned around, as if to put them to death; according to
                the commandment God had given him.</p>

            <p>4 When Adam and Eve came to the eastern border of the garden—thinking in
                their hearts that the cherub was not watching—as they were standing by the
                gate as if wishing to go in, suddenly came the cherub with a flashing sword of
                fire in his hand; and when he saw them, he went forth to kill them. For he was
                afraid that God would destroy him if they went into the garden without His
                order.</p>

            <p>5 And the sword of the cherub seemed to shoot flames a distance away from it.
                But when he raised it over Adam and Eve, the flame of the sword did not flash
                forth.</p>

            <p>6 Therefore the cherub thought that God was favorable to them, and was
                bringing them back into the garden. And the cherub stood wondering.</p>

            <p>7 He could not go up to Heaven to determine God's order regarding their
                getting into the garden; he therefore continued to stand by them, unable as he
                was to part from them; for he was afraid that if they should enter the garden
                without permission, God would destroy him.</p>

            <p>8 When Adam and Eve saw the cherub coming towards them with a flaming
                sword of fire in his hand, they fell on their faces from fear, and were as dead.</p>

            <p>9 At that time the heavens and the earth shook; and another cherubim came
                down from heaven to the cherub who guarded the garden, and saw him
                amazed and silent.</p>

            <p>10 Then, again, other angels came down close to the place where Adam and
                Eve were. They were divided between joy and sorrow.</p>

            <p>11 They were glad, because they thought that God was favorable to Adam, and
                wished him to return to the garden; and wished to restore him to the gladness
                he once enjoyed.</p>

            <p>12 But they sorrowed over Adam, because he was fallen like a dead man, he
                and Eve; and they said in their thoughts, "Adam has not died in this place; but
                God has put him to death, for his having come to this place, and wishing to get
                into the garden without His permission."</p>


            <P>
                <H2 id="55">Chapter 55</H2>
                <h3>The Conflict between God and Satan.</h3>
            </P> 

            <p>1 Then came the Word of God to Adam and Eve, and raised them from their
                dead state, saying to them, "Why did you come up here? Do you intend to go
                into the garden, from which I brought you out? It cannot be today; but only
                when the covenant I have made with you is fulfilled."</p>

            <p>2 Then Adam, when he heard the Word of God, and the fluttering of the angels
                whom he did not see, but only heard the sound of them with his ears, he and
                Eve cried, and said to the angels:—</p>

            <p>3 "O Spirits, who wait on God, look at me, and at my being unable to see you!
                For when I was in my former bright nature, then I could see you. I sang praises
                as you do; and my heart was far above you.</p>

            <p>4 But now, that I have transgressed, that bright nature is gone from me, and I
                am come to this miserable state. And now I have come to this, that I cannot
                see you, and you do not serve me like you used to do. For I have become
                animal flesh.</p>

            <p>5 Yet now, O angels of God, ask God with me, to restore me to that wherein I
                was formerly; to rescue me from this misery, and to remove from me the
                sentence of death He passed on me, for having trespassed against Him."</p>

            <p>6 Then, when the angels heard these words, they all grieved over him; and
                cursed Satan who had misled Adam, until he came from the garden to misery;
                from life to death; from peace to trouble; and from gladness to a strange land.</p>

            <p>7 Then the angels said to Adam, "You obeyed Satan, and ignored the Word of
                God who created you; and you believed that Satan would fulfil all he had
                promised you.</p>

            <p>8 But now, O Adam, we will make known to you, what came over us though
                him, before his fall from heaven.</p>

            <p>9 He gathered together his hosts, and deceived them, promising to give them
                a great kingdom, a divine nature; and other promises he made them.</p>

            <p>10 His hosts believed that his word was true, so they yielded to him, and
                renounced the glory of God.</p>

            <p>11 He then sent for us—according to the orders in which we were—to come
                under his command, and to accept his vein promise. But we would not, and we
                did not take his advice.</p>

            <p>12 Then after he had fought with God, and had dealt forwardly with Him, he
                gathered together his hosts, and made war with us. And if it had not been for
                God's strength that was with us, we could not have prevailed against him to
                hurl him from heaven.</p>

            <p>13 But when he fell from among us, there was great joy in heaven, because of
                his going down from us. For if he had remained in heaven, nothing, not even
                one angel would have remained in it.</p>

            <p>14 But God in His mercy, drove him from among us to this dark earth; for he
                had become darkness itself and a worker of unrighteousness.</p>

            <p>15 And he has continued, O Adam, to make war against you, until he tricked
                you and made you come out of the garden, to this strange land, where all
                these trials have come to you. And death, which God brought to him, he has
                also brought to you, O Adam, because you obeyed him, and trespassed against
                God."</p>

            <p>16 Then all the angels rejoiced and praised God, and asked Him not to destroy
                Adam this time, for his having sought to enter the garden; but to bear with him
                until the fulfillment of the promise; and to help him in this world until he was
                free from Satan's hand.</p>
                
            <P>
                <H2 id="56">Chapter 56</H2>
                <h3>A chapter of divine comfort.</h3>
            </P> 

            <p>1 Then came the Word of God to Adam, and said to him:—</p>

            <p>2 "O Adam, look at that garden of joy and at this earth of toil, and behold the
                garden is full of angels, but look at yourself alone on this earth with Satan
                whom you obeyed.</p>

            <p>3 Yet, if you had submitted, and been obedient to Me, and had kept My Word,
                you would be with My angels in My garden.</p>

            <p>4 But when you transgressed and obeyed Satan, you became his guests among
                his angels, that are full of wickedness; and you came to this earth, that brings
                forth to you thorns and thistles.</p>

            <p>5 O Adam, ask him who deceived you, to give you the divine nature he
                promised you, or to make you a garden as I had made for you; or to fill you
                with that same bright nature with which I had filled you.</p>

            <p>6 Ask him to make you a body like the one I made you, or to give you a day of
                rest as I gave you; or to create within you a reasonable soul, as I created for
                you; or to take you from here to some other earth than this one which I gave
                you. But, O Adam, he will not fulfil even one of the things he told you.</p>

            <p>7 Acknowledge, then, My favor towards you, and My mercy on you, My
                creature; that I have not avenged you for your transgression against Me, but in
                My pity for you I have promised you that at the end of the great five and a half
                days I will come and save you."</p>

            <p>8 Then God said again to Adam and Eve, "Get up, go down from here, before
                the cherub with a sword of fire in his hand destroys you."</p>

            <p>9 But Adam's heart was comforted by God's words to him, and he worshipped
                before Him.</p>

            <p>10 And God commanded His angels to escort Adam and Eve to the cave with
                joy, instead of the fear that had come over them.</p>

            <p>11 Then the angels took up Adam and Eve, and brought them down from the
                mountain by the garden, with songs and psalms, until they arrived at the cave.
                There the angels began to comfort and to strengthen them, and then departed
                from them towards heaven, to their Creator, who had sent them.</p>

            <p>12 But after the angels had departed from Adam and Eve, Satan came with
                shamefacedness, and stood at the entrance of the cave in which were Adam
                and Eve. He then called to Adam, and said, "O Adam, come, let me speak to
                you."</p>

            <p>13 Then Adam came out of the cave, thinking he was one of God's angels that
                was come to give him some good counsel.</p>

            <P>
                <H2 id="57">Chapter 57</H2>
                <h3>"Therefore I fell.… "</h3>
            </P> 

            <p>1 But when Adam came out and saw his hideous figure, he was afraid of him,
                and said to him, "Who are you?"</p>

            <p>2 Then Satan answered and said to him, "It is I, who hid myself within the
                serpent, and who spoke to Eve, and who enticed her until she obeyed my
                command. I am he who sent her, using my deceitful speech, to deceive you,
                until you both ate of the fruit of the tree and abandoned the command of God."</p>

            <p>3 But when Adam heard these words from him, he said to him, "Can you make
                me a garden as God made for me? Or can you clothe me in the same bright
                nature in which God had clothed me?</p>

            <p>4 Where is the divine nature you promised to give me? Where is that slick
                speech of yours that you had with us at first, when we were in the garden?"</p>

            <p>5 Then Satan said to Adam, "Do you think that when I have promised one
                something that I would actually deliver it to him or fulfil my word? Of course
                not. For I myself have never even thought of obtaining what I promised.</p>

            <p>6 Therefore I fell, and I made you fall by that for which I myself fell; and with
                you also, whosoever accepts my counsel, falls thereby.</p>

            <p>7 But now, O Adam, because you fell you are under my rule, and I am king over
                you; because you have obeyed me and have transgressed against your God.
                Neither will there be any deliverance from my hands until the day promised
                you by your God."</p>

            <p>8 Again he said, "Because we do not know the day agreed on with you by your
                God, nor the hour in which you shall be delivered, for that reason we will
                multiply war and murder on you and your descendants after you.</p>

            <p>9 This is our will and our good pleasure, that we may not leave one of the sons
                of men to inherit our orders in heaven.</p>

            <p>10 For as to our home, O Adam, it is in burning fire; and we will not stop our
                evil doing, no, not one day nor one hour. And I, O Adam, shall set you on fire
                when you come into the cave to live there."</p>

            <p>11 When Adam heard these words he cried and mourned, and said to Eve,
                "Hear what he said; that he won't fulfil any of what he told you in the garden.
                Did he really then become king over us?</p>

            <p>12 But we will ask God, who created us, to deliver us out of his hands."</p>

                <H2 id="58">Chapter 58</H2>
                <h3>"About sunset on the 53rd day. . ."</h3>
            </P> 

            <p>1 Then Adam and Eve spread their hands before God, praying and begging Him
                to drive Satan away from them so that he can't harm them or force them to
                deny God.</p>

            <p>2 Then God sent to them at once, His angel, who drove away Satan from them.
                This happened about sunset, on the fifty-third day after they had come out of
                the garden.</p>

            <p>3 Then Adam and Eve went into the cave, and stood up and turned their faces
                to the ground, to pray to God.</p>

            <p>4 But before they prayed Adam said to Eve, "Look, you have seen what
                temptations have befallen us in this land. Come, let us get up, and ask God to
                forgive us the sins we have committed; and we will not come out until the end
                of the day next to the fortieth. And if we die in here, He will save us."</p>

            <p>5 Then Adam and Eve got up, and joined together in entreating God.</p>

            <p>6 They continued praying like this in the cave; neither did they come out of it,
                by night or by day, until their prayers went up out of their mouths, like a flame
                of fire.</p>

                he called to his hosts, and they came, all of them. Then he said to them, "Since
                Adam and Eve, whom we deceived, have agreed together to pray to God night
                and day, and to beg Him to deliver them, and since they will not come out of
                the cave until the end of the fortieth day.</p>

            <p>2 And since they will continue their prayers as they have both agreed to do,
                that He will deliver them out of our hands, and restore them to their former
                state, see what we shall do to them." And his hosts said to him, "Power is thine,
                O our lord, to do what you list."</p>

            <p>3 Then Satan, great in wickedness, took his hosts and came into the cave, in
                the thirtieth night of the forty days and one; and he beat Adam and Eve, until
                he left them dead.</p>

            <p>4 Then came the Word of God to Adam and Eve, who raised them from their
                suffering, and God said to Adam, "Be strong, and be not afraid of him who has
                just come to you."</p>

            <p>5 But Adam cried and said, "Where were you, O my God, that they should
                punish me with such blows, and that this suffering should come over us; over
                me and over Eve, Your handmaiden?"</p>

            <p>6 Then God said to him, "O Adam, see, he is lord and master of all you have, he
                who said, he would give you divinity. Where is this love for you? And where is
                the gift he promised?</p>

            <p>7 Did it please him just once, O Adam, to come to you, comfort you, strengthen
                you, rejoice with you, or send his hosts to protect you; because you have
                obeyed him, and have yielded to his counsel; and have followed his
                commandment and transgressed Mine?"</p>

            <p>8 Then Adam cried before the Lord, and said, "O Lord because I transgressed a
                little, You have severely punished me in return for it, I ask You to deliver me
                out of his hands; or else have pity on me, and take my soul out of my body
                now in this strange land."</p>

            <p>9 Then God said to Adam, "If only there had been this sighing and praying
                before, before you transgressed! Then would you have rest from the trouble in
                which you are now."</p>

            <p>10 But God had patience with Adam, and let him and Eve remain in the cave
                until they had fulfilled the forty days.</p>

            <p>11 But as to Adam and Eve, their strength and flesh withered from fasting and
                praying, from hunger and thirst; for they had not tasted either food or drink
                since they left the garden; nor were the functions of their bodies yet settled;
                and they had no strength left to continue in prayer from hunger, until the end
                of the next day to the fortieth. They were fallen down in the cave; yet what
                speech escaped from their mouths, was only in praises.</p>

                <h3>The Devil appears like an old man. He offers "a place of
                    rest."</h3>
            </P> 


            <p>1 Then on the eighty-ninth day, Satan came to the cave, clad in a garment of
                light, and girt about with a bright girdle.</p>

            <p>2 In his hands was a staff of light, and he looked most awful; but his face was
                pleasant and his speech was sweet.</p>

            <p>3 He thus transformed himself in order to deceive Adam and Eve, and to make
                them come out of the cave, before they had fulfilled the forty days.</p>

            <p>4 For he said within himself, "Now that when they had fulfilled the forty days'
                fasting and praying, God would restore them to their former state; but if He did
                not do so, He would still be favorable to them; and even if He had not mercy on
                them, would He yet give them something from the garden to comfort them; as
                already twice before."</p>

            <p>5 Then Satan drew near the cave in this fair appearance, and said:—</p>

            <p>6 "O Adam, get up, stand up, you and Eve, and come along with me, to a good
                land; and don't be afraid. I am flesh and bones like you; and at first I was a
                creature that God created.</p>

            <p>7 And it was so, that when He had created me, He placed me in a garden in the
                north, on the border of the world.</p>

            <p>8 And He said to me, 'Stay here!' And I remained there according to His Word,
                neither did I transgress His commandment.</p>

            <p>9 Then He made a slumber to come over me, and He brought you, O Adam, out
                of my side, but did not make you stay with me.</p>

            <p>11 Then I worried about you, for that while God had taken you out of my side,
                He had not let you stay with me.</p>

            <p>12 But God said to me: 'Do not worry about Adam, whom I brought out of your
                side; no harm will come to him.</p>

            <p>13 For now I have brought out of his side a help-meet* for him; and I have
                given him joy by so doing.'"</p>

            <p>14 Then Satan said again, "I did not know how it is you are in this cave, nor
                anything about this trial that has come over you—until God said to me,
                'Behold, Adam has transgressed, he whom I had taken out of your side, and
                Eve also, whom I took out of his side; and I have driven them out of the garden;
                I have made them live in a land of sorrow and misery, because they
                transgressed against Me, and have obeyed Satan. And look, they are in
                suffering until this day, the eightieth.'</p>

            <p>15 Then God said to me, 'Get up, go to them, and make them come to your
                place, and suffer not that Satan come near them, and afflict them. For they are
                now in great misery; and lie helpless from hunger.'</p>

            <p>16 He further said to me, 'When you have taken them to yourself, give them to
                eat of the fruit of the Tree of Life, and give them to drink of the water of peace;
                and clothe them in a garment of light, and restore them to their former state of
                grace, and leave them not in misery, for they came from you. But grieve not
                over them, nor repent of that which has come over them.</p>

            <p>17 But when I heard this, I was sorry; and my heart could not patiently bear it
                for your sake, O my child.</p>

            <p>18 But, O Adam, when I heard the name of Satan, I was afraid, and I said within
                myself, I will not come out because he might trap me as he did my children,
                Adam and Eve.</p>

            <p>19 And I said, 'O God, when I go to my children, Satan will meet me in the way,
                and war against me, as he did against them.'</p>

            <p>20 Then God said to me, 'Fear not; when you find him, hit him with the staff
                that is in thine hand, and don't be afraid of him, for you are of old standing,
                and he shall not prevail against you.'</p>

            <p>21 Then I said, 'O my Lord, I am old, and cannot go. Send Your angels to bring
                them.'</p>

            <p>22 But God said to me, 'Angels, verily, are not like them; and they will not
                consent to come with them. But I have chosen you, because they are your
                offspring and are like you, and they will listen to what you say.'</p>

            <p>23 God said further to me, 'If you don't have enough strength to walk, I will
                send a cloud to carry you and set you down at the entrance of their cave; then
                the cloud will return and leave you there.</p>

            <p>24 And if they will come with you, I will send a cloud to carry you and them.'</p>
            <p>25 Then He commanded a cloud, and it bear me up and brought me to you;
                and then went back.</p>

            <p>26 And now, O my children, Adam and Eve, look at my old gray hair and at my
                feeble state, and at my coming from that distant place. Come, come with me,
                to a place of rest."</p>

            <p>27 Then he began to cry and to sob before Adam and Eve, and his tears poured
                on the ground like water.</p>

            <p>28 And when Adam and Eve raised their eyes and saw his beard, and heard his
                sweet talk, their hearts softened towards him; they obeyed him, for they
                believed he was true.</p>

            <p>29 And it seemed to them that they were really his offspring, when they saw
                that his face was like their own; and they trusted him.</p>

            <p>* The existence of the two words helpmeet and helpmate, meaning exactly the same thing, is a
                comedy of errors. God's promise to Adam, as rendered in the King James version of the Bible,
                was to give him an help meet for him (that is, a helper fit for him). In the 17th century the two
                words help and meet in this passage were mistaken for one word, applying to Eve, and thus
                helpmeet came to mean a wife. Then in the 18th century, in a misguided attempt to make
                sense of the word, the spelling helpmate was introduced. Both errors are now beyond recall,
                and both spellings are acceptable.</p>

                <h3>They begin to follow Satan.</h3>
            </P> 

            <p>1 Then he took Adam and Eve by the hand, and began to bring them out of the
                cave.</p>

            <p>2 But when they had come a little ways out of it, God knew that Satan had
                overcome them, and had brought them out before the forty days were ended,
                to take them to some distant place, and to destroy them.</p>

            <p>3 Then the Word of the Lord God again came and cursed Satan, and drove him
                away from them.</p>

            <p>4 And God began to speak to Adam and Eve, saying to them, "What made you
                come out of the cave, to this place?"</p>

            <p>5 Then Adam said to God, "Did you create a man before us? For when we were
                in the cave there suddenly came to us a friendly old man who said to us, 'I am
                a messenger from God to you, to bring you back to some place of rest.'</p>

            <p>6 And we believed, O God, that he was a messenger from you; and we came
                out with him; and knew not where we should go with him."</p>

            <p>7 Then God said to Adam, "See, that is the father of evil arts, who brought you
                and Eve out of the Garden of Delights. And now, indeed, when he saw that you
                and Eve both joined together in fasting and praying, and that you came not out
                of the cave before the end of the forty days, he wished to make your purpose
                vein, to break your mutual bond; to cut off all hope from you, and to drive you
                to some place where he might destroy you.</p>

            <p>8 Because he couldn't do anything to you unless he showed himself in the
                likeness of you.</p>

            <p>9 Therefore he came to you with a face like your own, and began to give you
                tokens as if they were all true.</p>

            <p>10 But because I am merciful and am favorable to you, I did not allow him to
                destroy you; instead I drove him away from you.</p>

            <p>11 Now, therefore, O Adam, take Eve, and return to your cave, and remain in it
                until the morning after the fortieth day. And when you come out, go towards
                the eastern gate of the garden."</p>

            <p>12 Then Adam and Eve worshipped God, and praised and blessed Him for the
                deliverance that had come to them from Him. And they returned towards the
                cave. This happened in the evening of the thirty-ninth day.</p>

            <p>13 Then Adam and Eve stood up and with a fiery passion, prayed to God, to
                give them strength; for they had become weak because of hunger and thirst
                and prayer. But they watched the whole of that night praying, until morning.</p>

            <p>14 Then Adam said to Eve, "Get up, let us go towards the eastern gate of the
                garden as God told us."</p>

            <p>15 And they said their prayers as they were accustomed to do every day; and
                they left the cave to go near to the eastern gate of the garden.</p>

            <p>16 Then Adam and Eve stood up and prayed, and appealed to God to
                strengthen them, and to send them something to satisfy their hunger.</p>

            <p>17 But after they finished their prayers, they were too weak to move.</p>

            <p>18 Then came the Word of God again, and said to them, "O Adam, get up, go
                and bring the two figs here."</p>

            <p>19 Then Adam and Eve got up, and went until they came near to the cave.</p>

                <h3>Two fruit trees.</h3>
            </P> 

            <p>1 But Satan the wicked was envious, because of the consolation God had given
                them.</p>

            <p>2 So he prevented them, and went into the cave and took the two figs, and
                buried them outside the cave, so that Adam and Eve should not find them. He
                also had in his thoughts to destroy them.</p>

            <p>3 But by God's mercy, as soon as those two figs were in the ground, God
                defeated Satan's counsel regarding them; and made them into two fruit trees,
                that overshadowed the cave. For Satan had buried them on the eastern side of
                it.</p>

            <p>4 Then when the two trees were grown, and were covered with fruit, Satan
                grieved and mourned, and said, "It would have been better to have left those
                figs where they were; for now, behold, they have become two fruit trees,
                whereof Adam will eat all the days of his life. Whereas I had in mind, when I
                buried them, to destroy them entirely, and to hide them forever.</p>

            <p>5 But God has overturned my counsel; and would not that this sacred fruit
                should perish; and He has made plain my intention, and has defeated the
                counsel I had formed against His servants."</p>

            <p>6 Then Satan went away ashamed because he hadn't thought his plans all the
                way through.</p>

                <h3>The first joy of trees.</h3>
            </P> 


            <p>1 But Adam and Eve, as they got closer to the cave, saw two fig trees, covered
                with fruit, and overshadowing the cave.</p>

            <p>2 Then Adam said to Eve, "It seems to me that we have gone the wrong way.
                When did these two trees grow here? It seems to me that the enemy wishes to
                lead us the wrong way. Do you suppose that there is another cave besides this
                one in the earth?</p>

            <p>3 Yet, O Eve, let us go into the cave, and find in it the two figs; for this is our
                cave, in which we were. But if we should not find the two figs in it, then it
                cannot be our cave."</p>

            <p>4 They went then into the cave, and looked into the four corners of it, but
                found not the two figs.</p>

            <p>5 And Adam cried and said to Eve, "Did we go to the wrong cave, then, O Eve?
                It seems to me these two fig trees are the two figs that were in the cave." And
                Eve said, "I, for my part, do not know."</p>

            <p>6 Then Adam stood up and prayed and said, "O God, You commanded us to
                come back to the cave, to take the two figs, and then to return to you.</p>

            <p>7 But now, we have not found them. O God, have you taken them, and sown
                these two trees, or have we gone astray in the earth; or has the enemy
                deceived us? If it be real, then, O God, reveal to us the secret of these two
                trees and of the two figs."</p>

            <p>8 Then came the Word of God to Adam, and said to him, "O Adam, when I sent
                you to fetch the figs, Satan went before you to the cave, took the figs, and
                buried them outside, eastward of the cave, thinking to destroy them; and not
                sowing them with good intent.</p>

            <p>9 Not for his mere sake, then, have these trees grown up at once; but I had
                mercy on you and I commanded them to grow. And they grew to be two large
                trees, that you be overshadowed by their branches, and find rest; and that I
                made you see My power and My marvelous works.</p>

            <p>10 And, also, to show you Satan's meanness, and his evil works, for ever since
                you came out of the garden, he has not ceased, no, not one day, from doing
                you some harm. But I have not given him power over you."</p>

            <p>11 And God said, "From now on, O Adam, rejoice on account of the trees, you
                and Eve; and rest under them when you feel weary. But do not eat any of their
                fruit or come near them."</p>

            <p>12 Then Adam cried, and said, "O God, will You again kill us, or will You drive
                us away from before Your face, and cut our life from off the face of the earth?</p>

            <p>13 O God, I beg you, if You know that there be in these trees either death or
                some other evil, as at the first time, root them up from near our cave, and with
                them; and leave us to die of the heat, of hunger and of thirst.</p>

            <p>14 For we know Your marvelous works, O God, that they are great, and that by
                Your power You can bring one thing out of another, without one's wish. For
                Your power can make rocks to become trees, and trees to become rocks."</p>

            <p>1 Then God looked at Adam and at his strength of mind, at his endurance of
                hunger and thirst, and of the heat. And He changed the two fig trees into two
                figs, as they were at first, and then said to Adam and to Eve, "Each of you may
                take one fig." And they took them, as the Lord commanded them.</p>

            <p>2 And He said to them, "You must now go into the cave and eat the figs, and
                satisfy your hunger, or else you will die."</p>

            <p>3 So, as God commanded them, they went into the cave about sunset. And
                Adam and Eve stood up and prayed during the setting sun.</p>

            <p>4 Then they sat down to eat the figs; but they knew not how to eat them; for
                they were not accustomed to eat earthly food. They were afraid that if they
                ate, their stomach would be burdened and their flesh thickened, and their
                hearts would take to liking earthly food.</p>

            <p>5 But while they were thus seated, God, out of pity for them, sent them His
                angel, so they wouldn't perish of hunger and thirst.</p>

            <p>6 And the angel said to Adam and Eve, "God says to you that you do not have
                the strength that would be required to fast until death; eat, therefore, and
                strengthen your bodies; for you are now animal flesh and cannot subsist
                without food and drink."</p>

            <p>7 Then Adam and Eve took the figs and began to eat of them. But God had put
                into them a mixture as of savory bread and blood.</p>

            <p>8 Then the angel went from Adam and Eve, who ate of the figs until they had
                satisfied their hunger. Then they put aside what was left; but by the power of
                God, the figs became whole again, because God blessed them.</p>

            <p>9 After this Adam and Eve got up, and prayed with a joyful heart and renewed
                strength, and praised and rejoiced abundantly the whole of that night. And this
                was the end of the eighty-third day.</p>

                <h3>Adam and Eve acquire digestive organs. Final hope of
                    returning to the Garden is lost.</h3>
            </P> 

            <p>1 And when it was day, they got up and prayed, after their custom, and then
                went out of the cave.</p>

            <p>2 But they became sick from the food they had eaten because they were not
                used to it, so they went about in the cave saying to each other:—</p>

            <p>3 "What has our eating caused to happen to us, that we should be in such
                pain? We are in misery, we shall die! It would have been better for us to have
                died keeping our bodies pure than to have eaten and defiled them with food."</p>

            <p>4 Then Adam said to Eve, "This pain did not come to us in the garden, neither
                did we eat such bad food there. Do you think, O Eve, that God will plague us
                through the food that is in us, or that our innards will come out; or that God
                means to kill us with this pain before He has fulfilled His promise to us?"</p>

            <p>5 Then Adam besought the Lord and said, "O Lord, let us not perish through
                the food we have eaten. O Lord, don't punish us; but deal with us according to
                Your great mercy, and forsake us not until the day of the promise You have
                made us."</p>

            <p>6 Then God looked at them, and then fitted them for eating food at once; as to
                this day; so that they should not perish.</p>

            <p>7 Then Adam and Eve came back into the cave sorrowful and crying because of
                the alteration of their bodies. And they both knew from that hour that they
                were altered beings, that all hope of returning to the garden was now lost; and
                that they could not enter it.</p>

            <p>8 For that now their bodies had strange functions; and all flesh that requires
                food and drink for its existence, cannot be in the garden.</p>

            <p>9 Then Adam said to Eve, "Behold, our hope is now lost; and so is our trust to
                enter the garden. We no longer belong to the inhabitants of the garden; but
                from now on we are earthy and of the dust, and of the inhabitants of the earth.
                We shall not return to the garden, until the day in which God has promised to
                save us, and to bring us again into the garden, as He promised us."</p>

            <p>10 Then they prayed to God that He would have mercy on them; after which,
                their mind was quieted, their hearts were broken, and their longing was cooled
                down; and they were like strangers on earth. That night Adam and Eve spent in
                the cave, where they slept heavily by reason of the food they had eaten.</p>


            <P>
                <H2 id="66">Chapter 66</H2>
                <h3>Adam does his first day's work.</h3>
            </P> 

            <p>1 When it was morning, the day after they had eaten food, Adam and Eve
                prayed in the cave, and Adam said to Eve, "Look, we asked for food of God,
                and He gave it. But now let us also ask Him to give us a drink of water."</p>

            <p>2 Then they got up, and went to the bank of the stream of water, that was on
                the south border of the garden, in which they had before thrown themselves.
                And they stood on the bank, and prayed to God that He would command them
                to drink of the water.</p>

            <p>3 Then the Word of God came to Adam, and said to him, "O Adam, your body
                has become brutish, and requires water to drink. Take some and drink it, you
                and Eve, then give thanks and praise."</p>

            <p>4 Adam and Eve then went down to the stream and drank from it, until their
                bodies felt refreshed. After having drunk, they praised God, and then returned
                to their cave, after their former custom. This happened at the end of eighty￾three days.</p>

            <p>5 Then on the eighty-fourth day, they took the two figs and hung them in the
                cave, together with the leaves thereof, to be to them a sign and a blessing
                from God. And they placed them there so that if their descendants came there,
                they would see the wonderful things God had done for them.</p>

            <p>6 Then Adam and Eve again stood outside the cave, and asked God to show
                them some food with which they could nourish their bodies.</p>

            <p>7 Then the Word of God came and said to him, "O Adam, go down to the
                westward of the cave until you come to a land of dark soil, and there you shall
                find food."</p>

            <p>8 And Adam obeyed the Word of God, took Eve, and went down to a land of
                dark soil, and found there wheat* growing in the ear and ripe, and figs to eat;
                and Adam rejoiced over it.</p>

            <p>9 Then the Word of God came again to Adam, and said to him, "Take some of
                this wheat and make yourselves some bread with it, to nourish your body
                therewith." And God gave Adam's heart wisdom, to work out the corn until it
                became bread.</p>

            <p>10 Adam accomplished all that, until he grew very faint and weary. He then
                returned to the cave; rejoicing at what he had learned of what is done with
                wheat, until it is made into bread for one's use.</p>

            <p>* In this book, the terms 'corn' and 'wheat' are used interchangeably. The reference is possibly
                used to indicate a type of ancient grain resembling Egyptian Corn also known as Durra. Durra
                is a wheat-like cereal grain frequently cultivated in dry regions such as Egypt.</p>

                <h3>"Then Satan began to lead astray Adam and Eve.…"</h3>
            </P> 

            <p>1 When Adam and Eve went down to the land of black mud and came near to
                the wheat God had showed them and saw that it was ripe and ready for
                reaping, they did not have a sickle to reap it with. So they readied themselves,
                and began to pull up the wheat by hand, until it was all done.</p>

            <p>2 Then they heaped it into a pile; and, faint from heat and from thirst, they
                went under a shady tree, where the breeze fanned them to sleep.</p>

            <p>3 But Satan saw what Adam and Eve had done. And he called his hosts, and
                said to them, "Since God has shown to Adam and Eve all about this wheat,
                wherewith to strengthen their bodies—and, look, they have come and made a
                big pile of it, and faint from the toil are now asleep—come, let us set fire to this
                heap of corn, and burn it, and let us take that bottle of water that is by them,
                and empty it out, so that they may find nothing to drink, and we kill them with
                hunger and thirst.</p>

            <p>4 Then, when they wake up from their sleep, and seek to return to the cave,
                we will come to them in the way, and will lead them astray; so that they die of
                hunger and thirst; when they may, perhaps, deny God, and He destroy them.
                So shall we be rid of them."</p>

            <p>5 Then Satan and his hosts set the wheat on fire and burned it up.</p>

            <p>6 But from the heat of the flame Adam and Eve awoke from their sleep, and
                saw the wheat burning, and the bucket of water by them, poured out.</p>

            <p>7 Then they cried and went back to the cave.</p>

            <p>8 But as they were going up from below the mountain where they were, Satan
                and his hosts met them in the form of angels, praising God.</p>

            <p>9 Then Satan said to Adam, "O Adam, why are you so pained with hunger and
                thirst? It seems to me that Satan has burnt up the wheat." And Adam said to
                him, "Yes."</p>

            <p>10 Again Satan said to Adam, "Come back with us; we are angels of God. God
                sent us to you, to show you another field of corn, better than that; and beyond
                it is a fountain of good water, and many trees, where you shall live near it, and
                work the corn field to better purpose than that which Satan has consumed."</p>

            <p>11 Adam thought that he was true, and that they were angels who talked with
                him; and he went back with them.</p>

            <p>12 Then Satan began to lead astray Adam and Eve eight days, until they both
                fell down as if dead, from hunger, thirst, and faintness. Then he fled with his
                hosts, and left them.</p>
                
            <P>

                <h3>How destruction and trouble is of Satan when he is
                    the master. Adam and Eve establish the custom of worship.</h3>
            </P> 

            <p>1 Then God looked at Adam and Eve, and at what had come over them from
                Satan, and how he had made them perish.</p>

            <p>2 God, therefore, sent His Word, and raised up Adam and Eve from their state
                of death.</p>

            <p>3 Then, Adam, when he was raised, said, "O God, You have burnt and taken
                from us the corn You have given us, and You have emptied out the bucket of
                water. And You have sent Your angels, who have caused us to lose our way
                from the corn field. Will You make us perish? If this be from you, O God, then
                take away our souls; but punish us not."</p>

            <p>4 Then God said to Adam, "I did not burn down the wheat, and I did not pour
                the water out of the bucket, and I did not send My angels to lead you astray.</p>

            <p>5 But it is Satan, your master who did it; he to whom you have subjected
                yourself; my commandment being meanwhile set aside. He it is, who burnt
                down the corn, and poured out the water, and who has led you astray; and all
                the promises he has made you were just a trick, a deception, and a lie.</p>

            <p>6 But now, O Adam, you shall acknowledge My good deeds done to you."</p>

            <p>7 And God told His angels to take Adam and Eve, and to bear them up to the
                field of wheat, which they found as before, with the bucket full of water.</p>

            <p>8 There they saw a tree, and found on it solid manna; and wondered at God's
                power. And the angels commanded them to eat of the manna when they were
                hungry.</p>

            <p>9 And God admonished Satan with a curse, not to come again, and destroy the
                field of corn.</p>

            <p>10 Then Adam and Eve took of the corn, and made of it an offering, and took it
                and offered it up on the mountain, the place where they had offered up their
                first offering of blood.</p>

            <p>11 And they offered this offering again on the altar they had built at first. And
                they stood up and prayed, and besought the Lord saying, "Thus, O God, when
                we were in the garden, our praises went up to you, like this offering; and our
                innocence went up to you like incense. But now, O God, accept this offering
                from us, and don't turn us away, deprived of Your mercy."</p>

            <p>12 Then God said to Adam and Eve, "Since you have made this offering and
                have offered it to Me, I shall make it My flesh, when I come down on earth to
                save you; and I shall cause it to be offered continually on an altar, for
                forgiveness and for mercy, for those who partake of it duly."</p>

            <p>13 And God sent a bright fire over the offering of Adam and Eve, and filled it
                with brightness, grace, and light; and the Holy Ghost came down on that
                offering.</p>

            <p>14 Then God commanded an angel to take fire tongs, like a spoon, and with it
                to take an offering and bring it to Adam and Eve. And the angel did so, as God
                had commanded him, and offered it to them.</p>

            <p>15 And the souls of Adam and Eve were brightened, and their hearts were filled
                with joy and gladness and with the praises of God.</p>

            <p>16 And God said to Adam, "This shall be to you a custom, to do so, when
                affliction and sorrow come over you. But your deliverance and your entrance in
                to the garden, shall not be until the days are fulfilled as agreed between you
                and Me; were it not so, I would, of My mercy and pity for you, bring you back to
                My garden and to My favor for the sake of the offering you have just made to
                My name."</p>

            <p>17 Adam rejoiced at these words which he heard from God; and he and Eve
                worshipped before the altar, to which they bowed, and then went back to the
                Cave of Treasures.</p>

            <p>18 And this took place at the end of the twelfth day after the eightieth day,
                from the time Adam and Eve came out of the garden.</p>

            <p>19 And they stood up the whole night praying until morning; and then went out
                of the cave.</p>

            <p>20 Then Adam said to Eve, with joy of heart, because of the offering they had
                made to God, and that had been accepted of Him, "Let us do this three times
                every week, on the fourth day Wednesday, on the preparation day Friday, and
                on the Sabbath Sunday, all the days of our life."</p>

            <p>21 And as they agreed to these words between themselves, God was pleased
                with their thoughts, and with the resolution they had each taken with the
                other.</p>

            <p>22 After this, came the Word of God to Adam, and said, "O Adam, you have
                determined beforehand the days in which sufferings shall come over Me, when
                I am made flesh; for they are the fourth Wednesday, and the preparation day
                Friday.</p>

            <p>23 But as to the first day, I created in it all things, and I raised the heavens.
                And, again, through My rising again on this day, will I create joy, and raise
                them on high, who believe in Me; O Adam, offer this offering, all the days of
                your life."</p>

            <p>24 Then God withdrew His Word from Adam.</p>

            <p>25 But Adam continued to offer this offering thus, every week three times, until
                the end of seven weeks. And on the first day, which is the fiftieth, Adam made
                an offering as he was accustomed, and he and Eve took it and came to the
                altar before God, as He had taught them.</p>

                <h3>Twelfth apparition of Satan to Adam and Eve, while
                    Adam was praying over the offering on the altar; when Satan beat
                    him.</h3>
            </P> 

            <p>1 Then Satan, the hater of all good, envious of Adam and of his offering
                through which he found favor with God, hastened and took a sharp stone from
                among the sharp iron stones; appeared in the form of a man, and went and
                stood by Adam and Eve.</p>

            <p>2 Adam was then offering on the altar, and had begun to pray, with his hands
                spread before God.</p>

            <p>3 Then Satan hastened with the sharp iron stone he had with him, and with it
                pierced Adam on the right side, from which flowed blood and water, then Adam
                fell on the altar like a corpse. And Satan fled.</p>

            <p>4 Then Eve came, and took Adam and placed him below the altar. And there
                she stayed, crying over him; while a stream of blood flowed from Adam's side
                over his offering.</p>

            <p>5 But God looked at the death of Adam. He then sent His Word, and raised him
                up and said to him, "Fulfil your offering, for indeed, Adam, it is worth much,
                and there is no shortcoming in it."</p>

            <p>6 God said further to Adam, "Thus will it also happen to Me, on the earth, when
                I shall be pierced and blood and water shall flow from My side and run over My
                body, which is the true offering; and which shall be offered on the altar as a
                perfect offering."</p>

            <p>7 Then God commanded Adam to finish his offering, and when he had ended it
                he worshipped before God, and praised Him for the signs He had showed him.</p>

            <p>8 And God healed Adam in one day, which is the end of the seven weeks; and
                that is the fiftieth day.</p>

            <p>9 Then Adam and Eve returned from the mountain, and went into the Cave of
                Treasures, as they were used to do. This completed for Adam and Eve, one
                hundred and forty days since their coming out of the garden.</p>

            <p>10 Then they both stood up that night and prayed to God. And when it was
                morning, they went out, and went down westward of the cave, to the place
                where their corn was, and there rested under the shadow of a tree, as they
                were accustomed.</p>

            <p>11 But when there a multitude of beasts came all around them. It was Satan's
                doing, in his wickedness; in order to wage war against Adam through marriage.</p>

                <h3>Thirteenth apparition of Satan, to trick Adam into
                    marrying Eve.</h3>
            </P> 

            <p>1 After this Satan, the hater of all good, took the form of an angel, and with
                him two others, so that they looked like the three angels who had brought to
                Adam gold, incense, and myrrh.</p>

            <p>2 They passed before Adam and Eve while they were under the tree, and
                greeted Adam and Eve with fair words that were full of deceit.</p>

            <p>3 But when Adam and Eve saw their pleasant expression, and heard their
                sweet speech, Adam rose, welcomed them, and brought them to Eve, and they
                remained all together; Adam's heart the while, being glad because he thought
                concerning them, that they were the same angels, who had brought him gold,
                incense, and myrrh.</p>

            <p>4 Because, when they came to Adam the first time, there came over him from
                them, peace and joy, through their bringing him good tokens; so Adam thought
                that they had come a second time to give him other tokens for him to rejoice
                therewith. For he did not know it was Satan; therefore he received them with
                joy and consorted with them.</p>

            <p>5 Then Satan, the tallest of them, said, "Rejoice, O Adam, and be glad. Look,
                God has sent us to you to tell you something."</p>

            <p>6 And Adam said, "What is it?" Then Satan answered, "It is a simple thing, yet it
                is the Word of God, will you accept it from us and do it? But if you will not
                accept it, we will return to God, and tell Him that you would not receive His
                Word."</p>

            <p>7 And Satan said again to Adam, "Don't be afraid and don't tremble; don't you
                know us?"</p>

            <p>8 But Adam said, "I do not know you."</p>

            <p>9 Then Satan said to him, "I am the angel that brought you gold, and took it to
                the cave; this other angel is the one that brought you incense; and that third
                angel, is the one who brought you myrrh when you were on top of the
                mountain, and who carried you to the cave.</p>

            <p>10 But as to the other angels our fellows, who bare you to the cave, God has
                not sent them with us this time; for He said to us, 'You will be enough'."</p>

            <p>11 So when Adam heard these words he believed them, and said to these
                angels, "Speak the Word of God, that I may receive it."</p>

            <p>12 And Satan said to him, "Swear, and promise me that you will receive it."</p>

            <p>13 Then Adam said, "I do not know how to swear and promise."</p>

            <p>14 And Satan said to him, "Hold out your hand, and put it inside my hand."</p>

            <p>15 Then Adam held out his hand, and put it into Satan's hand; when Satan said
                to him, "Say, now—So true as God is living, rational, and speaking, who raised
                the stars in heaven, and established the dry ground on the waters, and has
                created me out of the four elements*, and out of the dust of the earth—I will
                not break my promise, nor renounce my word."</p>

            <p>16 And Adam swore thus.</p>

            <p>17 Then Satan said to him, "Look, it is now some time since you came out of
                the garden, and you know neither wickedness nor evil. But now God says to
                you, to take Eve who came out of your side, and to marry her so that she will
                bear you children, to comfort you, and to drive from you trouble and sorrow;
                now this thing is not difficult, neither is there any scandal in it to you.</p>

            <p>* See the previous footnote in chapter XXXIV regarding the 'four elements'.</p>

            <P>
                <H2 id="71">Chapter 71</H2>
                <h3>Adam is troubled by the thought of marrying Eve.</h3>
            </P> 

            <p>1 But when Adam heard these words from Satan, he sorrowed much, because
                of his oath and of his promise, and said, "Shall I commit adultery with my flesh
                and my bones, and shall I sin against myself, for God to destroy me, and to blot
                me out from off the face of the earth?</p>

            <p>2 Since, when at first, I ate of the tree, He drove me out of the garden into this
                strange land, and deprived me of my bright nature, and brought death over
                me. If, then, I should do this, He will cut off my life from the earth, and He will
                cast me into hell, and will plague me there a long time.</p>

            <p>3 But God never spoke the words that you have said; and you are not God's
                angels, and you weren't sent from Him. But you are devils that have come to
                me under the false appearance of angels. Away from me; you cursed of God!"</p>

            <p>4 Then those devils fled from before Adam. And he and Eve got up, and
                returned to the Cave of Treasures, and went into it.</p>

            <p>5 Then Adam said to Eve, "If you saw what I did, don't tell anyone; for I sinned
                against God in swearing by His great name, and I have placed my hand
                another time into that of Satan." Eve, then, held her peace, as Adam told her.</p>

            <p>6 Then Adam got up, and spread his hands before God, beseeching and
                entreating Him with tears, to forgive him what he had done. And Adam
                remained thus standing and praying forty days and forty nights. He neither ate
                nor drank until he dropped down on the ground from hunger and thirst.</p>

            <p>7 Then God sent His Word to Adam, who raised him up from where he lay, and
                said to him, "O Adam, why have you sworn by My name, and why have you
                made agreement with Satan another time?"</p>

            <p>8 But Adam cried, and said, "O God, forgive me, for I did this unwittingly;
                believing they were God's angels."</p>

            <p>9 And God forgave Adam, saying to him, "Beware of Satan."</p>

            <p>10 And He withdrew His Word from Adam.</p>

            <p>11 Then Adam's heart was comforted; and he took Eve, and they went out of
                the cave, to prepare some food for their bodies.</p>

            <p>12 But from that day Adam struggled in his mind about his marrying Eve;
                afraid that if he was to do it, God would be angry with him.</p>

            <p>13 Then Adam and Eve went to the river of water, and sat on the bank, as
                people do when they enjoy themselves.</p>

            <p>14 But Satan was jealous of them; and planned to destroy them.</p>

            <P>
                <H2 id="72">Chapter 72</H2>
                <h3>Adam's heart is set on fire. Satan appears as beautiful
                    maidens.</h3>
            </P> 

            <p>1 Then Satan, and ten from his hosts, transformed themselves into maidens,
                unlike any others in the whole world for grace.</p>

            <p>2 They came up out of the river in presence of Adam and Eve, and they said
                among themselves, "Come, we will look at the faces of Adam and Eve, who are
                of the men on earth. How beautiful they are, and how different is their look
                from our own faces." Then they came to Adam and Eve, and greeted them; and
                stood wondering at them.</p>

            <p>3 Adam and Eve looked at them also, and wondered at their beauty, and said,
                "Is there, then, under us, another world, with such beautiful creatures as these
                in it?"</p>

            <p>4 And those maidens said to Adam and Eve, "Yes, indeed, we are an abundant
                creation."</p>

            <p>5 Then Adam said to them, "But how do you multiply?"</p>

            <p>6 And they answered him, "We have husbands who have married us, and we
                bear them children, who grow up, and who in their turn marry and are married,
                and also bear children; and thus we increase. And if so be, O Adam, you will
                not believe us, we will show you our husbands and our children."</p>

            <p>7 Then they shouted over the river as if to call their husbands and their
                children, who came up from the river, men and children; and every man came
                to his wife, his children being with him.</p>

            <p>8 But when Adam and Eve saw them, they stood dumb, and wondered at them.</p>

            <p>9 Then they said to Adam and Eve, "See all our husbands and our children? You
                should marry Eve, as we have married our husbands, so that you will have
                children as we have." This was a device of Satan to deceive Adam.</p>

            <p>10 Satan also thought within himself, "God at first commanded Adam
                concerning the fruit of the tree, saying to him, 'Eat not of it; else of death you
                shall die.' But Adam ate of it, and yet God did not kill him; He only decreed on
                him death, and plagues and trials, until the day he shall come out of his body.</p>

            <p>11 Now, then, if I deceive him to do this thing, and to marry Eve without God's
                permission, God will kill him then."</p>

            <p>12 Therefore Satan worked this apparition before Adam and Eve; because he
                sought to kill him, and to make him disappear from off the face of the earth.</p>

            <p>13 Meanwhile the fire of sin came over Adam, and he thought of committing
                sin. But he restrained himself, fearing that if he followed this advice of Satan,
                God would put him to death.</p>

            <p>14 Then Adam and Eve got up, and prayed to God, while Satan and his hosts
                went down into the river, in presence of Adam and Eve; to let them see that
                they were going back to their own world.</p>

            <p>15 Then Adam and Eve went back to the Cave of Treasures, as they usually
                did; about evening time.</p>

            <p>16 And they both got up and prayed to God that night. Adam remained
                standing in prayer, yet not knowing how to pray, by reason of the thoughts in
                his heart regarding his marrying Eve; and he continued so until morning.</p>

            <p>17 And when light came up, Adam said to Eve, "Get up, let us go below the
                mountain, where they brought us gold, and let us ask the Lord concerning this
                matter."</p>

            <p>18 Then Eve said, "What is that matter, O Adam?"</p>

            <p>19 And he answered her, "That I may request the Lord to inform me about
                marrying you; for I will not do it without His permission or else He will make us
                perish, you and me. For those devils have set my heart on fire, with thoughts of
                what they showed us, in their sinful apparitions.</p>

            <p>20 Then Eve said to Adam, "Why need we go below the mountain? Let us
                rather stand up and pray in our cave to God, to let us know whether this
                counsel is good or not."</p>

            <p>21 Then Adam rose up in prayer and said, "O God, you know that we
                transgressed against you, and from the moment we transgressed, we were
                stripped of our bright nature; and our body became brutish, requiring food and
                drink; and with animal desires.</p>

            <p>22 Command us, O God, not to give way to them without Your permission, for
                fear that You will turn us into nothing. Because if you do not give us
                permission, we shall be overpowered, and follow that advice of Satan; and You
                will again make us perish.</p>

            <p>23 If not, then take our souls from us; let us be rid of this animal lust. And if
                You give us no order respecting this thing, then sever Eve from me, and me
                from her; and place us each far away from the other.</p>

            <p>24 Then again, O God, if You separate us from each other, the devils will
                deceive us with their apparitions that resemble us, and destroy our hearts, and
                defile our thoughts towards each other. Yet if it is not each of us towards the
                other, it will, at all events, be through their appearance when the devils come
                to us in our likeness." Here Adam ended his prayer.</p>

                <h3>The marriage of Adam and Eve.</h3>
            </P> 

            <p>1 Then God considered the words of Adam that they were true, and that he
                could long await His order, respecting the counsel of Satan.</p>

            <p>2 And God approved Adam in what he had thought concerning this, and in the
                prayer he had offered in His presence; and the Word of God came to Adam and
                said to him, "O Adam, if only you had had this caution at first, before you came
                out of the garden into this land!"</p>

            <p>3 After that, God sent His angel who had brought gold, and the angel who had
                brought incense, and the angel who had brought myrrh to Adam, that they
                should inform him respecting his marriage to Eve.</p>

            <p>4 Then those angels said to Adam, "Take the gold and give it to Eve as a
                wedding gift, and promise to marry her; then give her some incense and myrrh
                as a present; and be you, you and she, one flesh."</p>

            <p>5 Adam obeyed the angels, and took the gold and put it into Eve's bosom in
                her garment; and promised to marry her with his hand.</p>

            <p>6 Then the angels commanded Adam and Eve to get up and pray forty days
                and forty nights; when that was done, then Adam was to have sexual
                intercourse with his wife; for then this would be an act pure and undefiled; so
                that he would have children who would multiply, and replenish the face of the
                earth.</p>

            <p>7 Then both Adam and Eve received the words of the angels; and the angels
                departed from them.</p>

            <p>8 Then Adam and Eve began to fast and pray, until the end of the forty days;
                and then they had sexual intercourse, as the angels had told them. And from
                the time Adam left the garden until he wedded Eve, were two hundred and
                twenty-three days, that is seven months and thirteen days.</p>

            <p>9 Thus was Satan's war with Adam defeated.</p>




            <!--

                <h3>The birth of Cain and Luluwa. Why they received
                    those names.</h3>
            </P> 

            <p>1 And they lived on the earth working in order to keep their bodies in good
                health; and they continued so until the nine months of Eve's pregnancy were
                over, and the time drew near when she must give birth.</p>

            <p>2 Then she said to Adam, "The signs placed in this cave since we left the
                garden indicate that this is a pure place and we will be praying in it again some
                time. It is not appropriate then, that I should give birth in it. Let us instead go
                to the sheltering rock cave that was formed by the command of God when
                Satan threw a big rock down on us in an attempt to kill us with it.</p>

            <p>3 Adam then took Eve to that cave. When the time came for her to give birth,
                she strained a lot. Adam felt sorry, and he was very worried about her because
                she was close to death and the words of God to her were being fulfilled: "In
                suffering shall you bear a child, and in sorrow shall you bring forth a child."</p>

            <p>4 But when Adam saw the distress in which Eve was, he got up and prayed to
                God, and said, "O Lord, look at me with the eye of Your mercy, and bring her
                out of her distress."</p>

            <p>5 And God looked at His maid-servant Eve, and delivered her, and she gave
                birth to her first-born son, and with him a daughter.</p>

            <p>6 The Adam rejoiced at Eve's deliverance, and also over the children she had
                borne him. And Adam ministered to Eve in the cave, until the end of eight
                days; when they named the son Cain, and the daughter Luluwa.</p>

            <p>7 The meaning of Cain is "hater," because he hated his sister in their mother's
                womb; before they came out of it. Therefore Adam named him Cain.
                8 But Luluwa means "beautiful," because she was more beautiful than her
                mother.</p>

            <p>9 Then Adam and Eve waited until Cain and his sister were forty days old,
                when Adam said to Eve, "We will make an offering and offer it up in behalf of
                the children."</p>

            <p>10 And Eve said, "We will make one offering for the first-born son and then
                later we shall make one for the daughter."</p>

                    and Aklia.</h3>
            </P> 

            <p>1 Then Adam prepared an offering, and he and Eve offered it up for their
                children, and brought it to the altar they had built at first.</p>

            <p>2 And Adam offered up the offering, and asked God to accept his offering.</p>

            <p>3 Then God accepted Adam's offering, and sent a light from heaven that shown
                on the offering. Adam and his son drew near to the offering, but Eve and the
                daughter did not approach it.</p>

            <p>4 Adam and his son were joyful as they came down from on the altar. Adam
                and Eve waited until the daughter was eighty days old, then Adam prepared an
                offering and took it to Eve and to the children. They went to the altar, where
                Adam offered it up, as he was accustomed, asking the Lord to accept his
                offering.</p>

            <p>5 And the Lord accepted the offering of Adam and Eve. Then Adam, Eve, and
                the children, drew near together, and came down from the mountain, rejoicing.</p>

            <p>6 But they returned not to the cave in which they were born; but came to the
                Cave of Treasures, in order that the children should go around in it, and be
                blessed with the tokens brought from the garden.</p>

            <p>7 But after they had been blessed with these tokens, they went back to the
                cave in which they were born.</p>

            <p>8 However, before Eve had offered up the offering, Adam had taken her, and
                had gone with her to the river of water, in which they threw themselves at first;
                and there they washed themselves. Adam washed his body and Eve hers also
                clean, after the suffering and distress that had come over them.</p>

            <p>9 But Adam and Eve, after washing themselves in the river of water, returned
                every night to the Cave of Treasures, where they prayed and were blessed;
                and then went back to their cave, where their children were born.</p>

            <p>10 Adam and Eve did this until the children had been weaned. After they were
                weaned, Adam made an offering for the souls of his children in addition to the
                three times every week he made an offering for them.</p>

            <p>11 When the children were weaned, Eve again conceived, and when her
                pregnancy came to term, she gave birth to another son and daughter. They
                named the son Abel and the daughter Aklia.</p>

            <p>12 Then at the end of forty days, Adam made an offering for the son, and at
                the end of eighty days he made another offering for the daughter, and treated
                them, as he had previously treated Cain and his sister Luluwa.</p>

            <p>13 He brought them to the Cave of Treasures, where they received a blessing,
                and then returned to the cave where they were born. After these children were
                born, Eve stopped having children.</p>

                <h3>Cain becomes jealous of Abel because of his sisters.</h3>
            </P> 

            <p>1 And the children began to grow stronger and taller; but Cain was hard-hearted, 
                and ruled over his younger brother.</p>

            <p>2 Often when his father made an offering, Cain would remain behind and not
                go with them, to offer up.</p>

            <p>3 But, as to Abel, he had a meek heart, and was obedient to his father and
                mother. He frequently moved them to make an offering, because he loved it.
                He prayed and fasted a lot.</p>

            <p>4 Then came this sign to Abel. As he was coming into the Cave of Treasures,
                and saw the golden rods, the incense and the myrrh, he asked his parents,
                Adam and Eve, to tell him about them and asked, "Where did you get these
                from?"</p>

            <p>5 Then Adam told him all that had befallen them. And Abel felt deeply about
                what his father told him.</p>

            <p>6 Furthermore his father, Adam, told him of the works of God, and of the
                garden. After hearing that, Abel remained behind after his father left and
                stayed the whole of that night in the Cave of Treasures.</p>

            <p>7 And that night, while he was praying, Satan appeared to him under the figure
                of a man, who said to him, "You have frequently moved your father into
                making offerings, fasting and praying, therefore I will kill you, and make you
                perish from this world."</p>

            <p>8 But as for Abel, he prayed to God, and drove away Satan from him; and did
                not believe the words of the devil. Then when it was day, an angel of God
                appeared to him, who said to him, "Do not cut short either fasting, prayer, or
                offering up an offering to your God. For, look, the Lord had accepted your
                prayer. Be not afraid of the figure which appeared to you in the night, and who
                cursed you to death." And the angel departed from him.</p>

            <p>9 Then when it was day, Abel came to Adam and Eve, and told them of the
                vision he had seen. When they heard it, they grieved much over it, but said
                nothing to him about it; they only comforted him.</p>

            <p>10 But as to the hard-hearted Cain, Satan came to him by night, showed
                himself and said to him, "Since Adam and Eve love your brother Abel so much
                more than they love you, they wish to join him in marriage to your beautiful
                sister because they love him. However, they wish to join you in marriage to his
                ugly sister, because they hate you.</p>

            <p>11 Now before they do that, I am telling you that you should kill your brother.
                That way your sister will be left for you, and his sister will be cast away."</p>

            <p>12 And Satan departed from him. But the devil remained behind in Cain's
                heart, and frequently aspired to kill his brother.</p>

                <h3>Cain, 15 years old, and Abel 12 years old, grow apart.</h3>
            </P> 

            <p>1 But when Adam saw that the older brother hated the younger, he
                endeavored to soften their hearts, and said to Cain, "O my son, take of the
                fruits of your sowing and make an offering to God, so that He might forgive you
                for your wickedness and sin."</p>

            <p>2 He said also to Abel, "Take some of your sowing and make an offering and
                bring it to God, so that He might forgive you for your wickedness and sin."</p>

            <p>3 Then Abel obeyed his father's voice, took some of his sowing, and made a
                good offering, and said to his father, Adam, "Come with me and show me how
                to offer it up."</p>

            <p>4 And they went, Adam and Eve with him, and they showed him how to offer
                up his gift on the altar. Then after that, they stood up and prayed that God
                would accept Abel's offering.</p>

            <p>5 Then God looked at Abel and accepted his offering. And God was more
                pleased with Abel than with his offering, because of his good heart and pure
                body. There was no trace of guile in him.</p>

            <p>6 Then they came down from the altar, and went to the cave in which they
                lived. But Abel, by reason of his joy at having made his offering, repeated it
                three times a week, after the example of his father Adam.</p>

            <p>7 But as to Cain, he did not want to make an offering, but after his father
                became very angry, he offered up a gift once. He took the smallest of his
                sheep for an offering and when he offered it up, his eyes were on the lamb.</p>

            <p>8 Therefore God did not accept his offering, because his heart was full of
                murderous thoughts.</p>

            <p>9 And they all thus lived together in the cave in which Eve had brought forth,
                until Cain was fifteen years old, and Abel twelve years old.</p>

                    family. How the first murder was planned.</h3>
            </P> 

            <p>1 Then Adam said to Eve, "Behold the children are grown up; we must think of
                finding wives for them."</p>

            <p>2 Then Eve answered, "How can we do it?"</p>

            <p>3 Then Adam said to her, "We will join Abel's sister in marriage to Cain, and
                Cain's sister to Abel.</p>

            <p>4 Then said Eve to Adam, "I do not like Cain because he is hard-hearted; but let
                them stay with us until we offer up to the Lord in their behalf."</p>

            <p>5 And Adam said no more.</p>

            <p>6 Meanwhile Satan came to Cain in the figure of a man of the field, and said to
                him, "Behold Adam and Eve have taken counsel together about the marriage of
                you two; and they have agreed to marry Abel's sister to you, and your sister to
                him.</p>

            <p>7 But if it was not that I love you, I would not have told you this thing. Yet if
                you will take my advice, and obey me, I will bring to you on your wedding day
                beautiful robes, gold and silver in plenty, and my relations will attend you."</p>

            <p>8 Then Cain said with joy, "Where are your relations?"</p>

            <p>9 And Satan answered, "My relations are in a garden in the north, where I once
                meant to bring your father Adam; but he would not accept my offer.</p>

            <p>10 But you, if you will receive my words and if you will come to me after your
                wedding, you shall rest from the misery in which you are; and you shall rest
                and be better off than your father Adam."</p>

            <p>11 At these words of Satan Cain opened his ears, and leaned towards his
                speech.</p>

            <p>12 And he did not remain in the field, but he went to Eve, his mother, and beat
                her, and cursed her, and said to her, "Why are you planning to take my sister
                to wed her to my brother? Am I dead?"</p>

            <p>13 His mother, however, quieted him, and sent him to the field where he had
                been.</p>

            <p>14 Then when Adam came, she told him of what Cain had done.</p>

            <p>15 But Adam grieved and held his peace, and said not a word.</p>

            <p>16 Then on the next morning Adam said to Cain his son, "Take of your sheep,
                young and good, and offer them up to your God; and I will speak to your
                brother, to make to his God an offering of corn."</p>

            <p>17 They both obeyed their father Adam, and they took their offerings, and
                offered them up on the mountain by the altar.</p>

            <p>18 But Cain behaved haughtily towards his brother, and shoved him from the
                altar, and would not let him offer up his gift on the altar; but he offered his own
                on it, with a proud heart, full of guile, and fraud.</p>

            <p>19 But as for Abel, he set up stones that were near at hand, and on that, he
                offered up his gift with a heart humble and free from guile.</p>

            <p>20 Cain was then standing by the altar on which he had offered up his gift; and
                he cried to God to accept his offering; but God did not accept it from him;
                neither did a divine fire come down to consume his offering.</p>

            <p>21 But he remained standing over against the altar, out of humor and
                meanness, looking towards his brother Abel, to see if God would accept his
                offering or not.</p>

            <p>22 And Abel prayed to God to accept his offering. Then a divine fire came down
                and consumed his offering. And God smelled the sweet savor of his offering;
                because Abel loved Him and rejoice in Him.</p>

            <p>23 And because God was well pleased with him, He sent him an angel of light
                in the figure of a man who had partaken of his offering, because He had
                smelled the sweet savor of his offering, and they comforted Abel and
                strengthened his heart.</p>

            <p>24 But Cain was looking on all that took place at his brother's offering, and was
                angry because of it.</p>

            <p>25 Then he opened his mouth and blasphemed God, because He had not
                accepted his offering.</p>

            <p>26 But God said to cain, "Why do you look sad? Be righteous, that I may accept
                your offering. Not against Me have you murmured, but against yourself.</p>

            <p>27 And God said this to Cain in rebuke, and because He abhorred him and his
                offering.</p>

            <p>28 And Cain came down from the altar, his color changed and with a sad face,
                and came to his father and mother and told them all that had befallen him. And
                Adam grieved much because God had not accepted Cain's offering.</p>

            <p>29 But Abel came down rejoicing, and with a gladsome heart, and told his
                father and mother how God had accepted his offering. And they rejoiced at it
                and kissed his face.</p>

            <p>30 And Abel said to his father, "Because Cain shoved me from the altar, and
                would not allow me to offer my gift on it, I made an altar for myself and offered
                my gift on it."</p>

            <p>31 But when Adam heard this he was very sorry, because it was the altar he
                had built at first, and on which he had offered his own gifts.</p>

            <p>32 As to Cain, he was so resentful and so angry that he went into the field,
                where Satan came to him and said to him, "Since your brother Abel has taken
                refuge with your father Adam, because you shoved him from the altar, they
                have kissed his face, and they rejoice over him, far more than over you."</p>

            <p>33 When Cain heard these words of Satan, he was filled with rage; and he let
                no one know. But he was laying wait to kill his brother, until he brought him
                into the cave, and then said to him:—</p>

            <p>34 "O brother, the country is so beautiful, and there are such beautiful and
                pleasurable trees in it, and charming to look at! But brother, you have never
                been one day in the field to take your pleasure in that place.</p>

            <p>35 Today, O, my brother, I very much wish you would come with me into the
                field, to enjoy yourself and to bless our fields and our flocks, for you are
                righteous, and I love you much, O my brother! But you have alienated yourself
                from me."</p>

            <p>36 Then Abel consented to go with his brother Cain into the field.</p>

            <p>37 But before going out, Cain said to Abel, "Wait for me, until I fetch a staff,
                because of wild beasts."</p>

            <p>38 Then Abel stood waiting in his innocence. But Cain, the forward, fetched a
                staff and went out.</p>
            <p>39 And they began, Cain and his brother Abel, to walk in the way; Cain talking
                to him, and comforting him, to make him forget everything.</p>


            <P>

                    Peace is shattered.</h3>
            </P> 

            <p>1 And so they went on, until they came to a lonely place, where there were no
                sheep; then Abel said to Cain, "Behold, my brother, we are tired from walking;
                for we see none of the trees, nor of the fruits, nor of the flourishing green
                plants, nor of the sheep, nor any one of the things of which you told me. Where
                are those sheep of thine you told me to bless?"</p>

            <p>2 Then Cain said to him, "Come on, and you shall see many beautiful things
                very soon, but go before me, until I catch up to you."</p>

            <p>3 Then went Abel forward, but Cain remained behind him.</p>

            <p>4 And Abel was walking in his innocence, without guile; not believing his
                brother would kill him.</p>

            <p>5 Then Cain, when he came up to him, comforted him with his talk, walking a
                little behind him; then he ran up to him and beat him with the staff, blow after
                blow, until he was stunned.</p>

            <p>6 But when Abel fell down on the ground, seeing that his brother meant to kill
                him, he said to Cain, "O, my brother, have pity on me. By the breasts we have
                sucked, don't hit me! By the womb that bore us and that brought us into the
                world, don't beat me to death with that staff! If you will kill me, take one of
                these large stones and kill me outright."</p>

            <p>7 Then Cain, the hard-hearted, and cruel murderer, took a large stone, and
                beat his brother's head with it, until his brains oozed out, and he wallowed in
                his blood, before him.</p>

            <p>8 And Cain repented not of what he had done.</p>

            <p>9 But the earth, when the blood of righteous Abel fell on it, trembled, as it
                drank his blood, and would have destroyed Cain because of it.</p>

            <p>10 And the blood of Abel cried mysteriously to God, to avenge him of his
                murderer.</p>

            <p>11 Then Cain began at once to dig the ground wherein to lay his brother; for he
                was trembling from the fear that came over him, when he saw the earth
                tremble on his account.</p>

            <p>12 He then cast his brother into the pit he made, and covered him with dust.
                But the ground would not receive him; but it threw him up at once.</p>

            <p>13 Again Cain dug the ground and hid his brother in it; but again the ground
                threw him up on itself; until three times the ground thus threw up on itself the
                body of Abel.</p>

            <p>14 The muddy ground threw him up the first time, because he was not the first
                creation; and it threw him up the second time and would not receive him,
                because he was righteous and good, and was killed without a cause; and the
                ground threw him up the third time and would not receive him, that there
                might remain before his brother a witness against him.</p>

            <p>15 And so the earth mocked Cain, until the Word of God, came to him
                concerning his brother.</p>

            <p>16 Then was God angry, and much displeased at Abel's death; and He
                thundered from heaven, and lightnings went before Him, and the Word of the
                Lord God came from heaven to Cain, and said to him, "Where is Abel your
                brother?"</p>

            <p>17 Then Cain answered with a proud heart and a gruff voice, "How, O God? Am
                I my brother's keeper?"</p>

            <p>18 Then God said to Cain, "Cursed be the earth that has drunk the blood of
                Abel your brother; and as for you, you will always be trembling and shaking;
                and this will be a mark on you so that whoever finds you, will kill you."</p>

            <p>19 But Cain cried because God had said those words to him; and Cain said to
                Him, "O God, whosoever finds me shall kill me, and I shall be blotted out from
                the face of the earth."</p>

            <p>20 Then God said to Cain, "Whoever finds you will not kill you;" because before
                this, God had been saying to Cain, "I shall put seven punishments on anyone
                that kills Cain." For as to the word of God to Cain, "Where is your brother?" God
                said it in mercy for him, to try and make him repent.</p>

            <p>21 For if Cain had repented at that time, and had said, "O God, forgive me my
                sin, and the murder of my brother," God would then have forgiven him his sin.</p>

            <p>22 And as to God saying to Cain, "Cursed be the ground that has drunk the
                blood of your brother." That also, was God's mercy on Cain. For God did not
                curse him, but He cursed the ground; although it was not the ground that had
                killed Abel, and committed a wicked sin.</p>

            <p>23 For it was fitting that the curse should fall on the murderer; yet in mercy did
                God so manage His thoughts as that no one should know it, and turn away
                from Cain.</p>

            <p>24 And He said to him, "Where is your brother?" To which he answered and
                said, "I know not." Then the Creator said to him, "Be trembling and quaking."</p>

            <p>25 Then Cain trembled and became terrified; and through this sign did God
                make him an example before all the creation, as the murderer of his brother.
                Also did God bring trembling and terror over him, that he might see the peace
                in which he was at first, and see also the trembling and terror he endured at
                the last; so that he might humble himself before God, and repent of his sin,
                and seek the peace that he enjoyed at first.</p>

            <p>26 And in the word of God that said, "I will put seven punishments on anyone
                who kills Cain," God was not seeking to kill Cain with the sword, but He sought
                to make him die of fasting, and praying and crying by hard rule, until the time
                that he was delivered from his sin.</p>

            <p>27 And the seven punishments are the seven generations during which God
                awaited Cain for the murder of his brother.</p>

            <p>28 But as to Cain, ever since he had killed his brother, he could find no rest in
                any place; but went back to Adam and Eve, trembling, terrified, and defiled
                with blood. . . .</p>

            The First Book of Adam and Eve details the life and times of Adam and Eve
            after they were expelled from the garden to the time that Cain kills his brother
            Abel. It tells of Adam and Eve's first dwelling—the Cave of Treasures; their
            trials and temptations; Satan's many apparitions to them; the birth of Cain,
            Abel, and their twin sisters; and Cain's love for his beautiful twin sister, Luluwa,
            whom Adam and Eve wished to join to Abel.

            This book is considered by many scholars to be part of the "Pseudepigrapha"
            (soo-duh-pig-ruh-fuh). The "Pseudepigrapha" is a collection of historical biblical
            works that are considered to be fiction. Because of that stigma, this book was
            not included in the compilation of the Holy Bible. This book is a written history
            of what happened in the days of Adam and Eve after they were cast out of the
            garden. Although considered to be pseudepigraphic by some, it carries
            significant meaning and insight into events of that time. It is doubtful that
            these writings could have survived all the many centuries if there were no
            substance to them.

            This book is simply a version of an account handed down by word of mouth,
            from generation to generation, linking the time that the first human life was
            created to the time when somebody finally decided to write it down. This
            particular version is the work of unknown Egyptians. The lack of historical
            allusion makes it difficult to precisely date the writing, however, using other
            pseudepigraphical works as a reference, it was probably written a few hundred
            years before the birth of Christ. Parts of this version are found in the Jewish
            Talmud, and the Islamic Koran, showing what a vital role it played in the
            original literature of human wisdom.

            The Egyptian author wrote in Arabic, but
            later translations were found written in Ethiopic. The present English
            translation was translated in the late 1800's by Dr. S. C. Malan and Dr. E.
            Trumpp. They translated into King James English from both the Arabic version
            and the Ethiopic version which was then published in The Forgotten Books of
            Eden in 1927 by The World Publishing Company. In 1995, the text was
            extracted from a copy of The Forgotten Books of Eden and converted to
            electronic form by Dennis Hawkins. It was then translated into more modern
            English by simply exchanging 'Thou' s for 'You's, 'Art's for 'Are's, and so forth.
            The text was then carefully re-read to ensure its integrity.
