                <h3>Eve Conceived Cain then Abel</h3>    
            </P>
        
                <p>1 This is the story of Adam and Eve after they had gone out of Paradise. And Adam knew his wife</p>
                <p>2 Eve and went upwards to the sun-rising and abode there eighteen years and two months. And</p>
                <p>3 Eve conceived and bare two sons; Adiaphotos, who is called Cain and Amilabes who is called Abel.</p>

            <P>
                <H2 id="2">Chapter 2</H2>
                <h3>The Dream of Eve</h3>    
            </P>
        
                <p>1 And after this, Adam and Eve were with one another and while they were sleeping, 
                    Eve said to Adam her lord: 'My lord, Adam, behold,</p>
                <p>2 I have seen in a dream this night the blood of my son Amilabes who is styled Abel 
                    being poured into the mouth of Cain his brother and he went on drinking it without pity. 
                    But he begged him to leave him a little of it. Yet he hearkened</p>
                <p>3 not to him, but gulped down the whole; nor did it stay in his stomach, 
                    but came out of his mouth. And Adam said, 'Let us arise and go</p>
                <p>4 and see what has happened to them. (I fear) lest the adversary may be assailing 
                    them somewhere.'</p>

            <P>
                <H2 id="3">Chapter 3</H2>
                <h3>The Murder of Abel</h3>    
            </P>

                <p>1 And they both went and found Abel murdered. I by the hand of Cain his brother. And God</p>
                <p>2 saith to Michael the archangel: 'Say to Adam: " Reveal not the secret that thou knowest to Cain thy son, 
                    for he is a son of wrath. But grieve not, for I will give thee another son in his stead; 
                    he shall show (to thee) all that thou shalt do. Do thou tell him nothing."' Thus spake the archangel</p>
                <p>3 to Adam. But he kept the word in his heart, and with him also Eve, though they grieved concerning Abel their son.</p>

                <h3>The Birth Seth</h3>    
            </P>

                <p>1 And after this, Adam knew Eve his wife, and she conceived and bare Seth.</p>
                <p>2 And Adam said to Eve: 'See! we have begotten a son in place of Abel, 
                    whom Cain slew, let us give glory and sacrifice to God.'</p>


            <P>
                <H2 id="5">Chapter 5</H2>
                <h3>Adam Felt His Forthcoming Death</h3>    
            </P>

                <p>1 And Adam begat thirty sons and thirty daughters and Adam lived nine hundred 
                    and thirty years; and he fell sick and cried with a loud</p>
                <p>2 voice and said, 'Let all my sons come to me that I may see them before I die.'</p>
                <p>3 And all assembled, for the earth was divided into three parts. And Seth his son said to him:</p>
                <p>4 'Father Adam, what is thy complaint?'</p>
                <p>5 And he saith, 'MY children, I am crushed by the burden of trouble.' And they say to him, 'What is trouble?'</p>
                

            <P>
                <H2 id="6">Chapter 6</H2>
                <h3>Seth Offered Adam Help</h3>    
            </P>

                <p>1 And Seth answered and said to him: 'Hast thou called to mind, father, the fruit of paradise of which 
                    thou usedst to eat, and hast been grieved in yearning for it?' 'If this be so, tell me, (and) I will go and</p>
                <p>2 bring thee fruit from paradise. For I will set dung upon my head and will weep and pray that the Lord will 
                    hearken to me and send his angel (and bring me a plant from paradise), and I will bring it thee that thy trouble 
                    may cease from thee.' Adam saith to him: 'Nay, my son Seth, but</p>
                <p>3 I have (much) sickness and trouble!' Seth saith to him: 'And how hath this come upon thee?'</p>

                <h3>Adam Told the Story How They was Tricked</h3>    
            </P>

                <p>1 And Adam said to him: 'When God made us, me and your mother, through whom also I die, He gave us power to eat 
                    of every tree which is in paradise, but, concerning that one only, He charged us not to eat of it, and through 
                    this one we are to die. And the hour drew nigh for the angels</p>
                <p>2 who were guarding your mother to go up and worship the Lord, and I was far from her, and the enemy knew that 
                    she was alone and gave to her, and she ate of the tree of which she had been told not to eat.</p>    
                <p>3 Then she gave also to me to eat.</p>

                <h3>The Seventy-Two Strokes of Pain</h3>    
            </P>

                <p>1 'And God was wroth with us, and the Lord came into paradise and called me in a terrible voice and said: 
                    "Adam, where art thou? And why hidest thou from my face? Shall the house be able to hide itself from its builder?" 
                    And he saith to me: "Since thou hast abandoned my covenant, I have brought upon thy body seventy-two strokes; 
                    the trouble of the first stroke is a pain of the eyes, the second stroke an affection of the hearing, 
                    and likewise in turn all the strokes shall befall thee."'</p>

                <h3>Eve Asked Adam to Give Her Half of Adam's Trouble</h3>    
            </P>

                <p>1 As he said this to his sons, Adam groaned sore and said: 'What shall I do? I am in great distress.'
                    And Eve wept and said: 'My lord</p>
                <p>2 Adam, rise up and give me half of thy trouble and I will endure it; for it is on my account that 
                    this hath happened to thee, on my account thou art beset with toils and troubles.' But Adam</p>
                <p>3 said to Eve, 'Arise and go with my son Seth near to paradise, and put earth upon your heads and 
                    weep and pray God to have mercy upon me and send his angel to paradise, and give me of the tree out 
                    of which the oil floweth, and bring it me, and I shall anoint myself and shall have rest from my complaint.'</p>

            </P>

                <p>1 Then Seth and Eve went towards paradise, and Eve saw her son, and a wild beast assailing him, 
                    and Eve wept and said: 'Woe is me; if</p>
                <p>2 I come to the day of the Resurrection, all those who have sinned will curse me saying: 
                    Eve hath not kept the commandment of God.' And she</p>
                <p>3 spake to the beast: 'Thou wicked beast, fearest thou not to fight with the image of God? 
                    How was thy mouth opened? How were thy teeth made strong? How didst thou not call to mind thy subjection? 
                    For long ago wast thou made subject to the image of God.' Then the beast</p>
                <p>4 cried out and said:</p>

                <h3>The Beast's Reply Against Eve</h3>    
            </P>

                <p>1 'It is not our concern, Eve, thy greed and thy wailing, but thine own; 
                    for (it is) from thee that the rule of the beasts hath arisen. How was thy</p>
                <p>2 mouth opened to eat of the tree concerning which God enjoined thee not to eat of it? 
                    On this account, our nature also hath been transformed. Now therefore thou canst not endure it,</p>
                <p>3 if I begin to reprove thee.'</p>

            </P>

                <p>1 Then Seth speaketh to the beast, 'Close thy mouth and be silent and stand off from 
                    the image of God until the day of Judgment.' Then saith</p>
                <p>2 the beast to Seth: 'Behold, I stand off from the image of God.' And he went to his lair.</p>

                <h3>God Promised the Ressurection of All Who Lived in Righteousness</h3>    
            </P>

                <p>1 And Seth went with Eve near paradise, and they wept there, and prayed God to send his angel 
                    and give them the oil of mercy.</p>

                    and entreaties concerning the tree which floweth with oil to anoint thy father Adam. 
                    For it shall not be thine now, but in the end of the times.</p>
                <p>3 Then shall all flesh be raised up from Adam till that great day,-all that shall be of the holy people. 
                    Then shall the delights of paradise be given to them and God shall be in their midst. And they shall no longer sin before his face, 
                    for the evil heart shall be taken from them and there shall be given them a heart understanding the good and to serve God only.</p>
                <p>4 But do thou go back to thy father. For the term of his life hath been fulfilled and he will live three days from to-day and will die.

                    which is lust, the root and beginning of every sin, and he bent the branch on the earth and I took of the

            </P> 

                <p>1 And Eve rose up and wiped off her tears with her hand, and the angel saith to her, ' Lift Up thyself</p>
                <p>2 from the earth.' And she gazed steadfastly into heaven, and beheld a chariot of light, borne by four bright eagles, 
                    (and) it were impossible for any man born of woman to tell the glory of them or</p>
                <p>3 behold their face -and angels going before the chariot- and when they came to the place where your father Adam was, 
                    the chariot halted and the Seraphim. And I beheld golden censers, between your father and the chariot, 
                    and all the angels with censers and frankincense came in haste to the</p>
                <p>5 incense-offering and blew upon it and the smoke of the incense veiled the firmaments. And the angels fell down and worshipped God, 
                    crying aloud and saying, JA'EL, Holy One, have pardon, for he is Thy image, and the work of Thy holy hands.'</p>

                <p>1 And I, Eve, beheld two great and fearful wonders standing in the presence of God and I wept for</p>
                <p>2 fear, and I cried aloud to my son Seth and said, 'Rise up, Seth, from the body of thy father Adam and come to me, 
                    and thou shalt see a spectacle which no man's eye hath yet beheld.'</p>

                <p>1 Then Seth arose and came to his mother and to her, he saith: 'What is thy trouble? Why weepest thou?' 
                    (And) she saith to him: 'Look</p>
                <p>2 up and see with thine eyes the seven heavens opened, and see how the soul of thy father lies on its face 
                    and all the holy angels are praying on his behalf and saying: 'Pardon him, Father of All, for he is Thine image." 'Pray, my child</p>
                <p>3 Seth, what shall this mean? And will he one day be delivered into the hands of the Invisible Father, even our God? But who are the two</p>

                <p>1 And Seth telleth his mother, that they are the sun and moon and themselves fall down and pray on behalf of my father Adam. Eve saith</p>
                <p>2 to him: 'And where is their light and why have they taken on such a black appearance?' And</p>
                <p>3 Seth answereth her, 'The light hath not left them, but they cannot shine before the Light of the Universe, the Father of Light; 
                    and on this account their light hath been hidden from them.</p>

                <p>1 Now while Seth was saying this to his mother, lo, an angel blew the trumpet, and there stood up all the angels (and they were) lying on their faces, 
                    and they cried aloud in an awful voice and said: 'Blessed (be) the glory of the Lord from</p>
                <p>2 the works of His making, for He hath pitied Adam the creature of His hands.' But when the</p>
                <p>3 angels had said these words, lo, there came one of the seraphim with six wings and snatched up Adam and carried him off to the Acherusian lake, 
                    and washed him thrice, in the presence of God.</p>

                <h3>God Announces the Future Restoration of Former Glory and the Judgement upon the Deceiver</h3>    
            </P>

                <p>1 And God saith to him: 'Adam, what hast thou done? If thou hadst kept my commandment, there would now be no rejoicing 
                    among those who are bringing thee down to this place. Yet, I tell thee that I will turn their joy to grief</p>
                <p>2 and thy grief will I turn to joy, and I will transform thee to thy former glory? and set thee on the throne of thy deceiver. </p>
                <p>3 But he shall be cast into this place to see thee sitting above him, then he shall be condemned and they that heard him, 
                    and he shall be grieved sore when he seeth thee sitting on his honourable throne.'</p>
                <p>4 And he stayed there three hours, lying down, and thereafter the Father of all, sitting on His holy throne stretched out his hand, 
                    and took Adam and handed him over to the archangel Michael saying: 'Lift him up into Paradise unto the third Heaven, 
                    and leave him there until that fearful day of my reckoning, which I will make in the world.' Then Michael took Adam and left</p> 
                <p>5 him where God told him.</p>

                <p>1 But after all this, the archangel asked concerning the laying out of the remains. And God</p>
                <p>2 commanded that all the angels should assemble in His presence, each in his order, and all the angels assembled, 
                    some having censers in their hands, and others trumpets. And lo ! the 'Lord</p>
                <p>3 of Hosts' came on and four winds drew Him and cherubim mounted on the winds and the angels from heaven escorting Him 
                    and they came on the earth, where was the body of Adam. And</p>
                <p>4 they came to paradise and all the leaves of paradise were stirred so that all men begotten of Adam slept from the fragrance save Seth alone, 
                    because he was born 'according to the appointment of God '. Then Adam's body lay there in</p>
                <p>5 paradise on the earth and Seth grieved exceedingly over him.</p>

            </P>
            
                <p>1 Then God spake to the archangel(s) Michael, (Gabriel, Uriel, and Raphael): 'Go away</p>
                <p>2 to Paradise in the third heaven, and strew linen clothes and cover the body of Adam and bring oil of the 'oil of fragrance' 
                    and pour it over him. And they acted thus did the three great angels and they prepared him for burial. </p>
                <p>3 And God said: 'Let the body of Abel also be brought.' And they brought other linen clothes and prepared his (body) also.</p>
                <p>4 For he was unburied since the day when Cain his brother slew him; for wicked Cain took great pains to conceal (him) but could not, 
                    for the earth would not receive him for the body sprang up from the earth and a voice went out of the earth saying: 'I will not</p>
                <p>5 receive a companion body, till the earth which was taken and fashioned in me cometh to me.' At that time, the angels took it and placed it on a rock, 
                     till Adam his father was buried. And</p>
                <p>6 both were buried, according to the commandment of God, in the spot where God found the dust, and He caused the place to be dug for two. 
                    And God sent seven angels to paradise and they</p>
                <p>7 brought many fragrant spices and placed them in the earth, and they took the two bodies and placed them in the spot which they had digged and builded.</p>

                <p>2 thee (that) earth thou art and to earth shalt thou return. Again I promise to thee the Resurrection; 
                    I will raise thee up in the Resurrection with every man who is of thy seed.'</p>

                <p>1 After these words, God made a seal and sealed the tomb, that no one might do anything to him 
                    for six days till his rib should return to him. Then the Lord and his angels went to their place.</p>
                <p>2 And Eve also, when the six days were fulfilled,</p>
                <p>3 fell asleep. But while she was living, she wept bitterly about Adam's falling on sleep, 
                    for she knew not where he was laid. For when the Lord came to paradise to bury Adam she was asleep, 
                    and her sons too, except Seth, till He bade Adam be prepared for burial; and no man knew on earth, 
                    except her son Seth. </p>
                <p>4 And Eve prayed (in the hour of her death) that she might be buried in the place where her husband Adam was. 
                    And after she had finished her prayer, she saith: 'Lord,</p>
                <p>5 Master, God of all rule, estrange not me thy handmaid from the body of Adam, 
                    for from his members didst thou make me. But deem me</p>
                <p>6 worthy, even me unworthy that I am and a sinner, to enter into his tabernacle, 
                    even as I was with him in paradise, both without separation from each other; just as in our transgression, we were</p>
                <p>7 (both) led astray and transgressed thy command, but were not separated. Even so, Lord, do not</p>
                <p>8 separate us now.' But after she had prayed, she gazed heavenwards and groaned aloud and smote her breast and said: 
                    'God of All, receive my spirit,' and straightway she delivered up her spirit to God.</p>

                <p>1 And Michael came and taught Seth how to prepare Eve for burial. And there came three angels and they buried her (body) 
                    where Adam's body was and Abel's. And thereafter Michael</p>
                <p>2 spake to Seth and saith: 'Lay out in this wise every man that dieth till the day of the Resurrection.
                    'And after giving him this rule; he</p>
                <p>3 saith to him: 'Mourn not beyond six days, but on the seventh day, rest and rejoice on it, because on that very day, 
                    God rejoiceth (yea) and we angels (too) with the righteous soul, who hath passed away from the earth.' Even thus spake</p>
