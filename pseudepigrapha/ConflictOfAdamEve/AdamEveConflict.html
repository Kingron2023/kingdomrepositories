  <P>
   We begin, with the help of God, to whom be glory, the
   writing of the Conflict of Adam and Eve, that befell them after
   they had come out of the garden, and while they dwelt in the
   Cave of Treasures, by command of God the Creator.*
  </P>



  <P>
   <H3>CHAPTER 1</H3>
  </P>

  <P>
  <SUP>1</SUP>On the third day,&dagger; God planted the garden in the east of
   the earth, on the border of the world eastward, beyond which,
   towards the sun-rising, one finds nothing but water, that
   encompasses the whole world, and reaches unto the borders of
   heaven.&ddagger;
  </P><BR>


  <P>
  <SUP>2</SUP>And to the north [of the garden] there is a sea of water,
   clear and pure to the taste, like unto nothing else; so that,
   through the clearness thereof, one may look into the depths of
   the earth.* And when a man washes himself in it, he becomes
   clean of the cleanness thereof, and white of its whiteness--even
   if he were dark.&dagger;
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>3</SUP>And God created that sea of His own good pleasure,&ddagger; for He
   knew what would come of the man He should make; so that
   after he had left the garden, on account of his transgression,
   men should he born in the earth, from among whom righteous
   ones should die, whose souls God would raise at the last day;
   when they should return to their flesh; should bathe in the
   water of that sea, and all of them repent of [their] sins.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>4</SUP>But when God made Adam go out of the garden, He did
   not place him on the border of it northward, lest he should
   draw near to the sea of water, and he and Eve wash themselves
   in it, be cleansed from their sins, forget the transgression they
   had committed, and be no longer reminded of it in the thought&sect;
   of their punishment.
  </P><BR>

 

  <P>
  <SUP>5</SUP>Then, again, as to the southern side [of the garden], God
   was not pleased to let Adam dwell there; because, when the
   wind blew from the north, it would bring him, on that southern
   side, the delicious smell of the trees of the garden. Wherefore
   God did not put Adam there, lest he should smell the sweet
   smell of [those] trees, forget his transgression, and find
   consolation for what he had done, take delight in the smell of
   the trees, and not be cleansed from his transgression.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>6</SUP> Again, also, because God is merciful and of great pity, and
   governs all things in a way He alone knows--He made our
   father Adam dwell in the western border of the garden, because
   on that side the earth is very broad. And God commanded
   him to dwell there in a cave in a rock--the Cave of Treasures
   below the garden.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
   <H3>CHAPTER 2</H3>
  </P>

  <P>
  <SUP>1</SUP>But when our father Adam, and Eve, went out of the
   garden, they trod [the ground] on their feet, not knowing
   they were treading.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>2</SUP>And when they came to the opening of the gate of the
   garden, and saw the broad earth spread before them, [covered]
   with stones large and small, and with sand, they feared and
   trembled, and fell on their faces, from the fear that came upon
   them; and they were as dead.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>3</SUP>Because--whereas they had hitherto been in the garden-
   land, beautiful<I>[ly planted]</I> with all manner of trees--they now
   saw themselves, in a strange land, which they knew not, and
   had never seen.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>4</SUP>[And] because at that time they were filled with the grace
   of a bright nature, and they had not hearts [turned] towards
   earth<I>[ly things]</I>.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>5</SUP>Therefore had God pity on them; and when He saw them
   fallen before the gate of the garden, He sent His Word* unto
   father Adam and Eve, and raised them from their fallen state.&dagger;
  </P><BR>

 
  <P>
   <H3>CHAPTER 3</H3>
  </P>

  <P>
  <SUP>1</SUP>God said to Adam, "I have ordained on this earth days and
   years, and thou and thy seed shall dwell and walk in it, until
   the days and years are fulfilled; when I shall send the Word
   that created thee, and against which thou hast transgressed,
   the Word that made thee come out of the garden, and that
   raised thee when thou wast fallen. Yea, the Word that will
   again save thee when the five days and a half are fulfilled."*
  </P><BR>

  <P>
    <SUP>2</SUP>But when Adam heard these words from God, and [of] the
    great five days and a half, he did not understand the meaning
    of them.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
    <SUP>3</SUP>For Adam was thinking that there would be but five days
    and a half for him, to the end of the world.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
    <SUP>4</SUP>And Adam wept, and prayed God to explain it to him.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
    <SUP>5</SUP>Then God in His mercy for Adam [who was made after] His
   own image and similitude, explained to him, that these were
   5000 and 500 years; and how One would then come and save
   him and his seed.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>6</SUP>But God had before that made this covenant with our father,&dagger;
   Adam, in the same terms, ere he came out of the garden, [when
   he was] by the tree whereof Eve took [the fruit] and gave it
   him to eat.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>7</SUP>Inasmuch as, when our father Adam came out of the garden,
   he passed by&ddagger; that tree, and saw how God had then changed
   the appearance of it into another form, and how it withered.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>8</SUP>And as Adam went to it he feared, trembled and fell down ;
   but God in His mercy lifted him up, and then made this covenant
   with him.&sect;
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>9</SUP>And, again, when Adam was by the gate of the garden,
   and saw the cherub with a sword of flashing fire in his hand,
   and the cherub grew angry and frowned at him, both Adam
   and Eve became afraid of him, and thought he meant to put
   them to death. So they fell on their faces, and trembled with
   fear.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>10</SUP>But he had pity on them, and showed them mercy; and
   turning [from them] went up to heaven, and prayed unto the
   Lord, and said:--
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>11</SUP>"Lord, Thou didst send me to watch at the gate of the
   garden, with a sword of fire.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>12</SUP>"But when Thy servants, Adam and Eve, saw me, they fell
   on their faces, and were as dead. O my Lord, what shall we do
   to Thy servants?"
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>13</SUP>Then God had pity on them, and showed them mercy, and
   sent His Angel to keep the garden.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>14</SUP>And the Word of the Lord came unto Adam and Eve, and
   raised them up.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>15</SUP>And the Lord said to Adam, "I told thee that at the end of
   five days and a half, I will send my Word and save thee.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>16</SUP>"Strengthen thy heart, therefore, and abide in the Cave of
   Treasures, of which I have before spoken to thee."
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>17</SUP>And when Adam heard this Word from God, he was comforted
   with that which God had told him. For He had told
   him how He would save him.
  </P><BR>

  
  <P>
   <H3>CHAPTER 4</H3>
  </P>

  <P>
  <SUP>1</SUP>But Adam and Eve wept for having come out of the garden,
   their first abode.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>2</SUP>And, indeed, when Adam looked at his flesh,* that was
   altered, he wept bitterly, he and Eve, over what they had done.
   And they walked and went gently down into the Cave of
   Treasures.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>3</SUP>And as they came to it Adam wept over himself and said to
   Eve, "Look at this cave that is to be our prison in this world,
   and a place of punishment!
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>4</SUP>"What is it compared with the garden? What is its
   narrowness compared with the space&dagger; of the other?
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>5</SUP>"What is this rock, by the side of those groves? What is
   the gloom of this cavern, compared with the light of the
   garden?
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>6</SUP>"What is this overhanging ledge of rock to shelter us,
   compared with the mercy of the Lord that overshadowed us?
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>7</SUP>"What is the soil of this cave compared with the gardenland?
   This earth, strewed with stones; and that, planted
   with delicious fruit-trees?"
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>8</SUP>And Adam said to Eve, "Look at thine eyes, and at mine,
   which afore beheld angels in heaven, praising; and they, too,
   without ceasing.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>8</SUP>"But now we do not see as we did: our eyes have become
   of flesh; they cannot see in like manner as they saw before."
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>9</SUP>Adam said again to Eve, "What is our body to-day,
   [compared] to what it was in former days, when we dwelt in
   the garden?"
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>10</SUP>After this Adam did not like to enter the cave, under the
   overhanging rock; nor would he ever have entered it.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>11</SUP>But he bowed to God's orders; and said to himself, "unless
   I enter the cave, I shall again be a transgressor."
  </P><BR>

  
  <P>
   <H3>CHAPTER 5</H3>
  </P>

  <P>
  <SUP>1</SUP>Then Adam and Eve entered the cave, and stood praying,
   in their own tongue, unknown to us, but which they knew
   well.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>2</SUP>And as they prayed, Adam raised his eyes, and saw the
   rock and the roof of the cave that covered [him] overhead,
   so that he could see neither heaven, nor God's creatures. So he
   wept and smote heavily upon his breast, until he dropped,
   and was as dead.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>3</SUP>And Eve sat weeping; for she believed he was dead.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>4</SUP>Then she arose, spread her hands towards God, suing Him
   for mercy and pity, and said, "God, forgive me my sin,
   [the sin] which I committed, and remember it not against
   me.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>5</SUP> "For I alone caused Thy servant to fall from the garden
   into this lost estate;* from light into this darkness; and from
   the abode of joy into this prison.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>6</SUP> "O God, look upon this Thy servant thus fallen,&dagger; and raise
   him from his death, that he may weep and repent of his
   transgression which he committed through me.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>7</SUP> "Take not away his soul this once; but let him [live] that
   he may stand after the measure of his repentance, and do Thy
   will, as before his death.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>8</SUP> "But if Thou do not raise him up, then, God, take away
   my own soul, [that I be] like him; and leave me not in this
   dungeon, one and alone; for I could not stand alone in this
   world, but with him [only].
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>9</SUP> "For Thou, O God, didst cause a slumber to come upon
   him, and didst take a bone from his side, and didst restore
   the flesh in the place of it, by Thy divine power.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>10</SUP> "And Thou didst take me, the bone, and make me a woman,
   bright like him, with heart, reason, and speech;&ddagger; and in flesh,
   like unto his own; and Thou didst make me after the likeness
   of his countenance, by Thy mercy and power.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>11</SUP>"O Lord, I and he are one, and Thou, God, art our
   Creator, Thou art [He] who made us both in one day.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>12</SUP> "Therefore, O God, give him life, that he may be with me
   in this strange land, while we dwell in it on account of our
   transgression.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>13</SUP> "But if Thou wilt not give him life, then take me, even me,
   like him; that we both may die the same day."&sect;
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>14</SUP> And Eve wept bitterly, and fell upon our father Adam; from
   her great sorrow.
  </P><BR>

 
  <P>
   <H3>CHAPTER 6</H3>
  </P>

  <P>
  <SUP>1</SUP>But God looked upon them; for they had killed themselves
   through great grief.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>2</SUP> But He would raise them and comfort them.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>3</SUP> He, therefore, sent His Word unto them; that they should
   stand and be raised forthwith.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>4</SUP> And the Lord said unto Adam and Eve, "You transgressed
   of your owp free will, until you came out of the garden in which
   I had placed you. Of your own free will have you transgressed
   through your desire for divinity, greatness, and an exalted state,
   such as I have; so that I deprived you of the bright nature in
   which you then were, and I made you come out of the garden
   to this land, rough and full of trouble.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>5</SUP> "If only you had not transgressed My commandment and
   had kept My law, and had not eaten of the [fruit of the] tree,
   near which I told you not to come! And there were fruit trees
   in the garden better than that one.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>6</SUP> "But the wicked Satan who continued not in his first
   estate, nor kept his faith; in whom was no good [intent]
   towards Me, [and who] though I had created him, yet set Me
   at naught, and sought the Godhead, so that I hurled him
   down from heaven,--he it is who made the tree* appear pleasant
   in your eyes, until you ate of it, by hearkening to him.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>7</SUP> "Thus have you transgressed My commandment, and therefore
   have I brought upon you all these sorrows.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>8</SUP> "For I am God the Creator, who, when I created My
   creatures, did not intend to destroy them. But after they had
   sorely roused My anger, I punished them with grievous plagues,
   until they repent.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>9</SUP> "But, if on the contrary, they still continue hardened in their
   transgression,&dagger; they shall be under a curse for ever."
  </P><BR>

  
  <P>
   <H3>CHAPTER 7</H3>
  </P>

  <P>
  <SUP>1</SUP>When Adam and Eve heard these words from God, they
   wept and sobbed yet more; but they strengthened their hearts
   in God, because they now felt that the Lord was to them like a
   father and a mother; and for this very reason, they wept before
   Him, and sought mercy from Him.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>2</SUP> Then God had pity on them, and said: "Adam, I have
   made My covenant with thee,* and I will not turn from it;
   neither will I let thee return to the garden, until My covenant
   of the great five days and a half is fulfilled."
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>3</SUP> Then Adam said unto God, "Lord, Thou didst create us,
   and make us [fit] to be in the garden; and before I transgressed,
   Thou madest all beasts come to me, that I should name them.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>4</SUP> "Thy grace was then on me; and I named every one according
   to Thy mind; and Thou madest them all subject unto me.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>5</SUP> "But now, Lord God, that I have transgressed Thy commandment,
   all beasts will rise against me and will devour me,
   and Eve Thy handmaid; and will cut off our life from the face
   of the earth.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>6</SUP> "I therefore beseech Thee, God, that, since Thou hast made
   us come out of the garden, and hast made us be in a strange
   land, Thou wilt not let the beasts hurt us."
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>7</SUP> When the Lord heard these words from Adam, He had pity
   on him, and felt that he had truly said that the beasts [of the
   field] would rise and devour him and Eve, because He, the
   Lord, was angry with them [two] on account of their transgression.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>8</SUP> Then God commanded the beasts, and the birds, and all that
   moves upon the earth, to come to Adam and to be familiar with
   him,&dagger; and not to trouble him and Eve; nor yet any of the good
   and righteous among their posterity.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>9</SUP> Then the beasts did obeisance to Adam, according to the
   commandment of God; except the serpent, against which God
   was wroth. It did not come to Adam, with the beasts.&ddagger;
  </P><BR>

   <P>
   <H3>CHAPTER 8</H3>
  </P>

  <P>
  <SUP>1</SUP>Then Adam wept and said, "[0] God, when we dwelt in
   the garden, and our hearts were lifted up, we saw the angels
   that sang praises in heaven, but now we do not see as we were
   used to do; nay, when we entered the cave, all creation became
   hidden from us."
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>2</SUP>Then God the Lord said unto Adam, "When thou wast
   under subjection [to Me], thou hadst a bright nature within
   thee, and for that reason couldst thou see things afar off. But
   after thy transgression thy bright nature was withdrawn from
   thee; and it was not left to thee to see things afar off, but only
   near at hand; after the ability of the flesh; for it is brutish."
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>3</SUP> When Adam and Eve had heard these words from God, they
   went their way; praising and worshipping Him with a sorrowful heart.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>4</SUP> And God ceased to commune with them.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
   <H3>CHAPTER 9</H3>
  </P>

  <P>
  <SUP>1</SUP>Then Adam and Eve came out of the Cave of Treasures, and
   drew near to the garden gate, and there they stood to look
   at it, and wept for having come away from it. And Adam
   and Eve went from before the gate of the garden to the
   southern side of it, and found there the water that watered the
   garden, from the root of the Tree of Life, and that parted
   itself from thence into four rivers over the earth.*
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>2</SUP> Then they came and drew near to that water, and looked at
   it; and saw&dagger; that it was the water that came forth from under
   the root of the Tree of Life in the garden. And Adam wept
   and wailed, and smote upon his breast, for being severed from
   the garden; and said to Eve:--
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>3</SUP> "Why hast thou brought upon me, upon thyself, and upon
   our seed, so [many] of [these] plagues and punishments?"
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>4</SUP> And Eve said unto him, "What is it thou hast seen, to
   weep and to speak to me in this wise?"
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>5</SUP> And he said to Eve, "Seest thou not this water that was
   with us in the garden, that watered the trees of the garden,
   and flowed out [thence]?
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>6</SUP> "And we, when we were in the garden, did not care about
   it;* but since we came to this strange land, we love it, and turn
   it to use for our body."
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>7</SUP>But when Eve heard these words from him, she wept; and
   from the soreness of their weeping, they fell into that water;
   and would have put an end to themselves in it, so as never
   again to return and behold the creation; for when they looked
   upon the work of creation, they [felt they must] put an end
   to themselves.&dagger;&dagger;
  </P><BR>

 
  <P>
   <H3>CHAPTER 10</H3>
  </P>

  <P>
  <SUP>1</SUP>Then God, merciful and gracious, looked upon them thus
   lying in the water, and nigh unto death, and sent an angel,
   who brought them out of the water, and laid them on the sea-
   shore as dead.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>2</SUP> Then the angel went up to God, was welcome, and said,
   "[O] God, Thy creatures have breathed their last."
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>3</SUP> Then God sent His Word unto Adam and Eve, who raised
   them from [their] death.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>4</SUP> And Adam said, after he was raised, "God, while we
   were in the garden we did not [require, or] care for this
   water;&ddagger;&ddagger; but since we came to this land we cannot do without it.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>5</SUP> Then God said to Adam, "While thou wast under My command
   and wast a bright angel, thou knewest not this water.*
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>7</SUP> "But after that thou hast transgressed My commandment,
   thou canst not do without water, wherein to wash thy body
   and make it grow; for it is now like [that of] beasts, and is
   in want of water."
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>8</SUP> When Adam and Eve heard these words from God, they
   wept a bitter cry; and Adam entreated God to let him return
   into the garden, and look at it a second time.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>9</SUP> But God said unto Adam, "I have made thee a promise;&dagger;
   when that promise is fulfilled, I will bring thee back into the
   garden, thee and thy righteous seed."
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>10</SUP> And God ceased to commune with Adam.
  </P><BR>

  
  <P>
   <H3>CHAPTER 11</H3>
  </P>

  <P>
  <SUP>1</SUP>Then Adam and Eve felt themselves burning with thirst, and
   heat, and sorrow.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>2</SUP> And Adam said to Eve, "We shall not drink of this water,
   even if we were to die. Eve, when this water comes into
   our inner parts, it will increase our punishments and that of
   our children, that shall come after us."
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>3</SUP> Both Adam and Eve then withdrew from the water, and
   drank none of it at all; but came and entered the Cave of
   Treasures.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>4</SUP> But [when in it] Adam could not see Eve; he only heard
   the noise she made. Neither could she see Adam, but heard
   the noise he made.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>5</SUP>Then Adam wept, in deep affliction, and smote upon his
   breast; and he arose and said to Eve, "Where art thou?"
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>6</SUP> And she said unto him, "Lo, I am standing in this darkness."
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>7</SUP> He then said to her, "Remember the bright nature in which
   we lived, while we abode in the garden!"
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>8</SUP> "O Eve! remember the glory* that rested on us in the
   garden.<SUP>26</SUP> O Eve! remember the trees that overshadowed us
   in the garden while we [moved] among them.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>9</SUP> "O Eve! remember that while we were in the garden, we
   knew neither night nor day . Think of the Tree of Life,&dagger; from
   below which flowed the water, and that shed lustre over
   us! Remember, Eve, the garden-land, and the brightness
   thereof!
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>10</SUP> "Think, oh think of that garden in which was no darkness,
   while we dwelt therein.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>11</SUP> "Whereas no sooner did we come into this Cave of Treasures
   than darkness compassed us round about; until we can no
   longer see each other; and all the pleasure of this life has
   come to an end."
  </P><BR>

   <P>
   <H3>CHAPTER 12</H3>
  </P>

  <P>
  <SUP>1</SUP>Then Adam smote upon his breast, he and Eve, and they
   mourned the whole night until dawn drew near, and they
   sighed over the length of the night in Miyazia. &ddagger;
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>2</SUP>And Adam beat himself, and threw himself on the ground in
   the cave, from bitter grief, and because of the darkness, and
   lay there as dead.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>3</SUP> But Eve heard the noise he made in falling upon the earth.
   And she felt about for him with her hands, and found him like
   a corpse.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>4</SUP>But Eve heard the noise he made in falling upon the earth.
   Then she was afraid, speechless, and remained by him.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>5</SUP> But, the merciful Lord looked on the death of Adam, and on
   Eve's silence from fear of the darkness.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>6</SUP> And the Word of God came unto Adam and raised him from
   his death, and opened Eve's mouth that she might speak.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>7</SUP> Then Adam arose in the cave and said, "God, wherefore
   has light departed from us, and darkness come over us?
   Wherefore dost Thou leave us in [this] long darkness? Why
   wilt Thou plague us thus?
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>8</SUP> "And this darkness, O Lord, where was it ere it came upon
   us? It is such, that we cannot see each other.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>9</SUP> "For, so long as we were in the garden, we neither saw nor
   even knew [what] darkness [is]. I was not hidden from Eve,
   neither was she [hidden] from me, until [now that] she cannot
   see me; and no darkness came upon us, to separate us from
   each other.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>10</SUP> "But she and I were both in one bright light. I saw her
   and she saw me. Yet now since we came into this cave, darkness
   has come upon us, and parted us asunder, so that I do
   not see her, and she does not see me.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>11</SUP> "Lord,* wilt Thou then plague us with this darkness?"
  </P><BR>

 
  <P>
   <H3>CHAPTER 13</H3>
  </P>

  <P>
  <SUP>1</SUP>Then when God, who is merciful and full of pity, heard
   Adam's voice. He said unto him:--
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>2</SUP> "Adam, so long as the good angel was obedient to Me,
   a bright light rested on him and on his hosts.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>3</SUP> "But when he transgressed My commandment, I deprived
   him of that bright nature, and he became dark.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>4</SUP> "And when he was in the heavens, in the realms of light, he
   knew naught of darkness.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>5</SUP> "But he transgressed, and I made him fall from heaven upon
   the earth ; and it was this darkness that came upon him.*
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>6</SUP> "And on thee, O Adam, while in My garden and obedient
   to Me, did that bright light rest also.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>7</SUP> "But when I heard of thy transgression,&dagger; I deprived thee
   of that bright light. Yet, of My mercy, I did not turn thee
   into darkness, but I made thee thy body of flesh, over which I
   spread this skin, in order that it may bear cold and heat.&ddagger;
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>8</SUP> "If I had let My wrath fall heavily upon thee, I should have
   destroyed thee ; and had I turned thee into darkness, it would
   have been as if I killed thee.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>9</SUP> "But in My mercy, I have made thee as thou art; when
   thou didst transgress My commandment, O Adam, I drove thee
   from the garden, and made thee come forth into this land; and
   commanded thee to dwell in this cave; and darkness came
   upon thee, as it did upon him who transgressed My commandment.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>10</SUP> "Thus, O Adam, has this night deceived thee. It is not to
   last for ever; but is only of twelve hours; when it is over,
   daylight will return.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>11</SUP> "Sigh not, therefore, neither be moved; and say not in thy
   heart that this darkness is long and drags on wearily; and say
   not in thy heart that I plague thee with it.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>12</SUP> "Strengthen thy heart, and be not afraid. This darkness is
   not a punishment. But, Adam, I have made the day, and
   have placed the sun in it to give light; in order that thou and
   thy children should do your work.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>13</SUP> "For I knew thou shouldest sin and transgress, and come
   out into this land. Yet would I not [force thee, nor] be hard
   upon thee, nor shut thee up ; nor doom thee through thy fall;&sect;
   nor through thy coming out from light into darkness; nor
   yet [through thy coming] from the garden into this land.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>14</SUP> "For I made thee of the hight; and I willed to bring out
   children of light from thee, and like unto thee.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>15</SUP> "But thou didst not keep one day My commandment; until I
   had finished the creation and blessed everything in it.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>16</SUP> "Then I commanded thee concerning the tree, that thou eat
   not thereof. Yet I knew that Satan, who deceived himself,
   would also deceive thee.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>17</SUP> "So I made known to thee by means of the tree, not to come
   near him.** And I told thee not to eat of the fruit thereof, nor
   to taste of it, nor yet to sit under it,&dagger;&dagger; nor to yield to it.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>18</SUP> "Had I not been and spoken to thee, O Adam, concerning
   the tree, and had I left thee without a commandment, and thou
   hadst sinned--it would have been an offence on My part, for
   not having given [thee] any order; thou wouldst turn round
   and blame Me [for it] .
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>19</SUP> "But I commanded thee, and warned thee, and thou didst
   fall. So that My creatures&ddagger;&ddagger; cannot blame me; but the blame
   rests on them alone.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>20</SUP> "And, O Adam, I have made the day for thee and for thy
   children after thee, for them to work, and toil therein. And I
   have made the night for them to rest in it from their work;
   and for the beasts [of the field] to go forth by night and seek
   their food.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>21</SUP> "But little of darkness now remains, O Adam; and daylight
   will soon appear."
  </P><BR>

   <P>
   <H3>CHAPTER 14</H3>
  </P>

  <P>
  <SUP>1</SUP>Then Adam said unto God: "O Lord, take Thou my soul,
   and let me not see this gloom any more; or remove me to some
   place where there is no darkness."
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>2</SUP> But God the Lord said to Adam, "Verily I say unto thee,
   this darkness will pass from thee, every day I have determined
   for thee, until the fulfilment of My covenant; when I will save
   thee and bring thee back again into the garden, into the abode
   of light thou longest for, wherein is no darkness. I will bring
   thee to it--in the kingdom of heaven."
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>3</SUP> Again said God unto Adam, "All this misery that thou
   hast been made to take upon thee because of thy transgression,
   will not free thee from the hand of Satan, and will not save
   thee."
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>4</SUP> "But I [will]. When I shall come down from heaven, and
   shall become flesh of thy seed, and take upon Me the infirmity
   from which thou sufferest, then the darkness that came upon
   thee in this cave shall come upon Me in the grave, when I am
   in the flesh of thy seed.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>5</SUP> "And I, who am without years, shall be subject to the
   reckoning of years, of times, of months, and of days, and I
   shall be reckoned as one of the sons of men, in order to save
   thee."
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>6</SUP> And God ceased to commune with Adam.*
  </P><BR>

  
  <P>
   <H3>CHAPTER 15</H3>
  </P>

  <P>
  <SUP>1</SUP>Then Adam and Eve wept and sorrowed by reason of God's
   word to them, that they should not return to the garden until
   the fulfilment of the days decreed upon them; but mostly
   because God had told them that He should suffer for their
   salvation.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
   <H3>CHAPTER 16</H3>
  </P>

  <P>
  <SUP>1</SUP>After this Adam and Eve ceased not to stand in the cave,
   praying and weeping, until the morning dawned upon them.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>2</SUP> And when they saw the light returned to them, they
   restrained from fear, and strengthened their hearts.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>3</SUP> Then Adam began to come out of the cave. And when he
   came to the mouth of it, and stood and turned his face towards
   the east, and saw the sun rise in glowing rays, and felt the heat
   thereof on his body, he was afraid of it, and thought in his
   heart that this flame came forth to plague him.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>4</SUP> He wept then, and smote upon his breast, and fell upon the
   earth on his face, and made his request, saying:--
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>5</SUP> "Lord, plague me not, neither consume me, nor yet take
   away my life from the earth."
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>6</SUP> For he thought the sun was God.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>7</SUP> Inasmuch as while he was in the garden and heard the voice
   of God and the sound He made in the garden, and feared Him,
   Adam never saw the brilliant light of the sun, neither did the
   flaming heat thereof touch his body.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>8</SUP> Therefore was he afraid of the sun when flaming rays of it
   reached him. He thought God meant to plague him therewith
   all the days He had decreed for him.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>9</SUP> For Adam also said in his thoughts. As God did not plague
   us with darkness, behold, He has caused [this sun] to rise and
   to plague us with burning heat.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>10</SUP> But while he was thus thinking in his heart, the Word of God
   came [unto him and said]:--
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>11</SUP> "Adam, arise and stand up. This sun is not God; but it
   has been created to give light by day, of which I spake unto
   thee in the cave [saying], 'that the dawn would break forth,
   and there would be light by day.'
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>12</SUP> "But I am God who comforted thee in the night."
   And God ceased to commune with Adam.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
   <H3>CHAPTER 17</H3>
  </P>

  <P>
  <SUP>1</SUP>Then Adam and Eve came out at the mouth of the cave, and
   went towards the garden.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>2</SUP> But as they drew near to it, before the western gate, from
   which Satan came when he deceived Adam and Eve, they found
   the serpent that became Satan coming at the gate, and sorrow-
   fully licking the dust, and wriggling on its breast on the
   ground, by reason of the curse that fell upon it from God.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>3</SUP> And whereas aforetime [the serpent] was the most exalted
   of all beasts, now it was changed and become slippery, and the
   meanest of them all, and it crept on its breast and went on its
   belly.<SUP>29</SUP>
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>4</SUP> And whereas it was the fairest of all beasts, it had been
   changed, and was become the ugliest of them all. Instead of
   feeding on the best food, now it turned to eat the dust. Instead
   of dwelling, as before, in the best places, now it lived in the
   dust.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>5</SUP>And, whereas it had been the most beautiful of all beasts,
   all of which stood dumb at its beauty, it was now abhorred of
   them.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>6</SUP> And, again, whereas it dwelt in one beautiful abode, to which
   all other animals came from elsewhere; [and] where it drank,
   they drank also of the same; now, after it had become
   venomous, by reason of God's curse, all beasts fled from its
   abode, and would not drink of the water it drank; but fled
   from it.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
   <H3>CHAPTER 18</H3>
  </P>

  <P>
  <SUP>1</SUP>When the accursed serpent saw Adam and Eve, it swelled
   its head, stood on its tail, and with eyes blood-red, did as if
   it would kill them.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>2</SUP> It made straight for Eve, and ran after her; while Adam
   standing by, wept because he had no stick in his hand
   wherewith to smite the serpent, and knew not how to put [it]
   to death.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>3</SUP> But with a heart burning for Eve, Adam approached the
   serpent, and held it by the tail; when it turned towards him
   and said unto him:--
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>4</SUP> "Adam, because of thee and of Eve, I am slippery, and
   go upon my belly." Then by reason of its great strength, it
   threw down Adam and Eve and pressed upon them, as if it
   would kill them.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>5</SUP>But God sent an angel who threw the serpent away from
   them, and raised them up.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>6</SUP> Then the Word of God came to the serpent, and said unto it,
   "In the first instance I made thee glib, and made thee to
   go upon thy belly; but I did not deprive thee of speech.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>7</SUP> "Now, however, be thou dumb ; and speak no more, thou and
   thy race because in the first place, has the ruin My creatures
   happened through thee, and now thou wishest to kill them."*
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>8</SUP> Then the serpent was struck dumb, and spake no more.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>9</SUP> And a wind came to blow from heaven by command of God,
   that carried away the serpent from Adam and Eve, threw it
   on the sea shore, and it landed in India.
  </P><BR>

 
  <P>
   <H3>CHAPTER 19</H3>
  </P>

  <P>
  <SUP>1</SUP>But Adam and Eve wept before God. And Adam said unto
   Him:—
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>2</SUP> "O Lord, when I was in the cave, I said this to Thee, my
   Lord, that the beasts [of the field] would rise and devour me,
   and cut off my life from the earth," Then Adam, by reason
   of what had befallen him, smote upon his breast, and fell upon
   the earth like a corpse; then came to him the Word of God,
   who raised him, and said unto him, "O Adam, not one of
   these beasts will be able to hurt thee; because when I made
   the beasts and other moving things come to thee in the cave,
   I did not let the serpent come with them, lest it should rise
   against you, make you tremble; and the fear of it should fall
   into your hearts. For I knew that the accursed one is
    wicked; therefore would I not let it come near you with the
   [other] beasts.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>3</SUP> "But now strengthen thy heart and fear not. I am with
   thee unto the end of the days I have determined on thee."
  </P><BR>

  <P>
   <H3>CHAPTER 20</H3>
  </P>

  <P>
  <SUP>1</SUP>Then Adam wept and said, "God, remove us to some
   other place, that the serpent may not come again near us, and
   rise against us. Lest it find Thy handmaid Eve alone and kill
   her; for its eyes are hideous [and] evil."
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>2</SUP> But God said to Adam and Eve, "Henceforth fear not, I
   will not let it come near you; I have driven it away from you,
   from this mountain; neither will I leave in it aught to hurt
   you."
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>3</SUP> Then Adam and Eve worshipped before God and gave Him
   thanks, and praised Him for having delivered them from death.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
   <H3>CHAPTER 21</H3>
  </P>

  <P>
  <SUP>1</SUP>Then Adam and Eve went in search of the garden.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>2</SUP> And the heat beat like a flame on their faces; and they
   sweated from the heat, and wept before the Lord.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>3</SUP> But the place where they wept was nigh unto a high
   mountain, facing the western gate of the garden.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>4</SUP> Then Adam threw himself down from the top of that
   mountain; his face was torn and his flesh was flayed; much
   blood flowed from him, and he was nigh unto death.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>5</SUP> Meanwhile Eve remained standing on the mountain weeping
   over him, thus lying.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>6</SUP> And she said, "I wish not to live after him; for all that he
   did to himself was through me."
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>7</SUP> Then she threw herself after him; and was torn and scotched
   by stones; and remained lying as dead.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>8</SUP> But the merciful God, who looks upon His creatures, looked
   upon Adam and Eve as they lay dead, and He sent His Word
   unto them, and raised them.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>9</SUP> And said to Adam, "O Adam, all this misery which thou
   hast wrought upon thyself, will not avail against [My] rule,
   neither will it alter the covenant of the 5500 years."
  </P><BR>

  <P>
   <H3>CHAPTER 22</H3>
  </P>

  <P>
  <SUP>1</SUP> Then Adam said to God, "I wither in the heat; I am faint
   from walking, and am loth of this world. And I know not
   when Thou wilt bring me out of it, to rest."
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>2</SUP> Then the Lord God said unto him, "Adam, it cannot be
   at present, [not] until thou hast ended* thy days. Then shall
   I bring thee out of this wretched land."
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>3</SUP> And Adam said to God, "While I was in the garden I knew
   neither heat, nor languor, neither moving about, nor trembling,
   nor fear; but now, since I came to this land, all this affliction
   has come upon me."
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>4</SUP> Then God said to Adam, "So long as thou wast keeping My
   commandment, My light and My grace rested on thee. But
   when thou didst transgress My commandment, sorrow and
   misery befell thee in this land."
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>5</SUP> And Adam wept and said, "O Lord, do not cut me off for
   this, neither smite me with heavy plagues, nor yet repay me
   according to my sin; For we, of our own will, did transgress
   Thy commandment, and forsook Thy law, and sought to
   become gods like unto Thee, when Satan the enemy&dagger; deceived
   us."
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>6</SUP> Then God said again unto Adam, " Because thou hast borne
   fear and trembling in this land, languor and suffering, treading
   and walking about, going upon this mountain, and dying
   [from it], I will take all this upon Myself in order to save
   thee."
  </P><BR>

 
  <P>
   <H3>CHAPTER 23</H3>
  </P>

  <P>
   First offering made by Adam.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>1</SUP>Then Adam wept more and said, "O God, have mercy on
   me, so far as to take upon Thee, that which I will do."
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>2</SUP> But God took His Word from Adam and Eve.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>3</SUP> Then Adam and Eve stood on their feet; and Adam said to
   Eve, "Gird thyself,&dagger; and I also will gird myself." And she
   girded herself, as Adam told her. Then Adam and Eve took
   stones and placed them in the shape of an altar;&ddagger; and they
   took leaves from the trees outside the garden, with which they
   wiped, from the face of the rock, the blood they had spilled.
   But that which had dropped on the sand, they took together
   with the dust [wherewith it was mingled] and offered it upon
   the altar as an offering unto God.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>4</SUP> Then Adam and Eve stood under the altar&sect; and wept, thus
   entreating God, "Forgive us our trespass and our sin, and
   look upon us with Thine eye of mercy. For when we were in
   the garden our praises and our hymns went up before Thee
   without ceasing.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>5</SUP> "But when we came into this strange land, pure praise was
   no longer ours, nor righteous prayer, nor understanding hearts,
   nor sweet thoughts, nor just counsels, nor long discernment,
   nor upright feelings, neither is our bright nature left us. But
   our body is changed from the similitude in which it was at first,
   when we were created.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>6</SUP> "Yet now look upon our blood which is offered upon these
   stones, and accept it at our hands, like the praises we used to
   sing unto Thee at first, when in the garden."
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>7</SUP> And Adam began to make more requests unto God.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
   <H3>CHAPTER 24</H3>
  </P>

  <P>
  <SUP>1</SUP> Then the merciful God, good and lover of men, looked upon
   Adam and Eve, and upon their blood, which they had held up
   as an offering unto Him ; without an order from Him [for so
   doing]. But He wondered at them; and accepted their
   offerings.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>2</SUP> And God sent from His presence a bright fire, that consumed
   their offering.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>3</SUP> He smelt the sweet savour of their offering, and showed
   them mercy.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>4</SUP> Then came the Word of God to Adam, and said unto him,
   "Adam, as thou hast shed thy blood, so will I shed My own
   blood when I become flesh of thy seed; and as thou didst die,
   O Adam, so also will I die. And as thou didst build an altar,
   so also will I make for thee an altar on the earth; and as thou
   didst offer thy blood upon it, so also will I offer My blood upon
   an altar on the earth."
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>5</SUP> "And as thou didst sue for forgiveness through that blood,
   so also will I make My blood forgiveness of sins, and blot out
   transgressions in it.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>6</SUP> "And now, behold, I have accepted thy offering, Adam,
   but the days of the covenant, wherein I have bound thee, are
   not fulfilled. When they are fulfilled, then will I bring thee
   back into the garden.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>7</SUP> "Now, therefore, strengthen thy heart; and when sorrow
   comes upon thee, make Me an offering, and I will be favourable
   to thee."
  </P><BR>

  <P>
   <H3>CHAPTER 25</H3>
  </P>

  <P>
  <SUP>1</SUP> But God knew that Adam had in his thoughts, that he
   should often kill himself and make an offering to Him of his
   blood.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>2</SUP> Therefore did He say unto him, "O Adam, do not again
   kill thyself as thou didst, by throwing thyself down from that
   mountain."
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>3</SUP> But Adam said unto God, "It was in my mind to put an
   end to myself at once, for having transgressed Thy commandments,
   and for my having come out of the beautiful garden;
   and for the bright light of which Thou hast deprived me; and
   for the praises which poured forth from my mouth without
   ceasing, and for the light that covered me.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>4</SUP> "Yet of Thy goodness, God, do not away with me
   altogether; but be favourable to me every time I die, and
   bring me to life.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>5</SUP> "And thereby it will be made known that Thou art a
   merciful God, who wiliest not that one should perish; who
   lovest not that one should fall; and who dost not condemn
   any one cruelly, badly, and by whole destruction."
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>6</SUP> Then Adam remained silent.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>7</SUP> And the Word of God came unto him, and blessed him, and
   comforted him, and covenanted with him, that He would save
   him at the end of the days determined upon him.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>8</SUP> This, then, was the first offering Adam made unto God;
   and so it became his custom to do.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
   <H3>CHAPTER 26</H3>
  </P>

  <P>
  <SUP>1</SUP>Then Adam took Eve, and they began to return to the Cave
   of Treasures where they dwelt. But when they neared it and
   saw it from afar, heavy sorrow fell upon Adam and Eve when
   they looked at it.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>2</SUP> Then Adam said to Eve, "When we were on the mountain
   we were comforted by the Word of God that conversed with
   us ;and the light that came from the east, shone over us.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>3</SUP> "But now the Word of God is hidden from us; and the light
   that shone over us is so changed as to disappear, and [let]
   darkness and sorrow come upon us.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>4</SUP> "And we are forced to enter this cave [which is] like a
   prison, wherein darkness covers us, so that we are parted
   from each other; and thou canst not see me, neither can I
   see thee."
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>5</SUP> When Adam had said these words, they wept and spread
   their hands before God; for they were full of sorrow.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>6</SUP> And they entreated God to bring the sun to them, to shine
   on them, so that darkness return not upon them, and they
   come not again under this covering of rock. And they wished
   to die rather than see the darkness.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>7</SUP> Then God looked upon Adam and Eve and upon their great
   sorrow, and upon all they had done with a fervent heart, on
   account of all the [trouble] they were in, instead of their
   former well-being, and on account of all the misery that came
   upon them in a strange land.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>8</SUP> Therefore God was not wroth with them; nor impatient
   with them; but He was long-suffering and forbearing towards
   them, as [towards] the children He had created.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>9</SUP> Then came the Word of God to Adam, and said unto him,
   "Adam, as for the sun, if I were to take it [and bring it to
   thee],* days, hours, years and months would all come to naught,
   and the covenant I have made with thee, would never be
   fulfilled.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>10</SUP> "But thou shouldest then be turned and left in a long
   plague, and no salvation would be left to thee for ever.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>11</SUP> "Yea, rather, bear long and calm thy soul while thou
   abidest night and day; until the fulfilment of the days, and
   the time of My covenant is come.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>12</SUP> "Then shall I come and save thee, Adam, for I do not
   wish that thou be afflicted.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>13</SUP> "And when I look at all the good things in which thou
   didst live, and why thou camest out of them, then would I
   willingly show thee mercy.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>14</SUP> "But I cannot alter the covenant that has gone out of
   My mouth; else would I have brought thee back into the
   garden.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>15</SUP> "When, however, the covenant is fulfilled, then shall I
   show thee and thy seed mercy, and bring thee into a land of
   gladness, where there is neither sorrow nor suffering; but
   abiding joy and gladness, and light that never fails, and
   praises that never cease; and a beautiful garden that shall
   never pass away."
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>16</SUP> And God said again unto Adam, "Be long suffering and
   enter the cave, for the darkness of which thou wast afraid,
   shall only be twelve hours long ; and when ended, light shall
   arise."
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>17</SUP> Then when Adam heard these words from God, he and Eve
   worshipped before Him, and their hearts were comforted.
   They returned into the cave after their custom, while tears
   flowed from their eyes, sorrow and wailing came from their
   hearts, and they wished their soul would leave their body.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>18</SUP> And Adam and Eve stood praying, until the darkness of
   night came upon them, and Adam was hid from Eve, and she
   from him.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>19</SUP> And they remained standing in prayer.
  </P><BR>

  
  <P>
    <H3>CHAPTER 27</H3>
    <I>First apparition of Satan to Adam.</I>
  </P>

  <P>
  <SUP>1</SUP> When Satan, the hater of all good, saw how they continued
   in prayer, and how God communed with them, and comforted
   them, and [how He had] accepted their offering--Satan made
   an apparition. He began with transforming his hosts; in
   his hands was a flashing fire, and they were in a great
   light.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>2</SUP>He then placed his throne near the mouth of the cave
   because he could not enter into it by reason of their prayers.
   And he shed light into the cave, until the cave glistened over
   Adam and Eve; while his hosts began to sing praises.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>3</SUP> And Satan did this, in order that when Adam saw the light,
   he should think within himself that it was a heavenly light,
   and that [Satan^s] hosts were angels ; and that God had sent
   them to watch at the cave, and to give him light in the
   darkness.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>4</SUP> So that when Adam came out of the cave and saw them,
   and Adam and Eve bowed to Satan, then he would overcome*
   Adam thereby, and a second time humble him before God.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>5</SUP> When, therefore, Adam and Eve saw the light, fancying it
   was real, they strengthened their hearts; yet, as they were
   trembling, Adam said to Eve:--
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>6</SUP> "Look at that great light, and at those many songs of
   praise, and at that host standing outside that do not come
   in to us, do not tell us what they say, or whence they come,
   or what is the meaning of this light; what those praises are;
   wherefore they have been sent hither, and why they do not
   come in.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>7</SUP> "If they were from God, they would come to us in the
   cave, and would tell us their errand."
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>8</SUP> Then Adam stood up and prayed unto God with a fervent
   heart, and said:--
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>9</SUP> "O Lord, is there in the world another god than Thou,
   who created angels and filled them with light, and sent them
   to keep us, who would come with them?
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>10</SUP> "But, lo we see these hosts that stand at the mouth of the
   cave; they are in a great light; they sing loud praises. If
   they are of some other god than Thou, tell me; and if they
   are sent by Thee, inform me of the reason for which Thou hast
   sent them."
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>11</SUP> No sooner had Adam said this, than an angel from God
   appeared unto him in the cave, who said unto him, "Adam,
   fear not. This is Satan and his hosts; he wishes to deceive
   you as he deceived you at first. For the first time, he was
   hidden in the serpent; but this time he is come to you in the
   similitude of an angel of light; in order that, when you
   worshipped him, he might enthrall you, in the very presence
   of God."
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>12</SUP> Then the angel went from Adam, and seized Satan at the
   opening of the cave, and stripped him of the feint he had
   assumed, and brought him in his own hideous form to Adam
   and Eve; who were afraid of him when they saw him.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>13</SUP> And the angel said to Adam, "This hideous form has been
   his ever since God made him fall [from heaven]. He could not
   have come near you in it; therefore did he transform himself
   into an angel of light."
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>14</SUP> Then the angel drove away Satan and his hosts from Adam
   and Eve, and said unto them, " Fear not; God who created
   you, will strengthen you."
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>15</SUP> And the angel went from them.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>16</SUP> But Adam and Eve remained standing in the cave ;no
   consolation came to them; they were divided [in their
   thoughts].
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>17</SUP> And when it was morning they prayed; and then went out
   to seek the garden. For their hearts were towards it, and
   they could get no consolation for having left it.
  </P><BR>

 
  <P>
    <H3>CHAPTER 28</H3>
    <I>Second apparition of Satan to Adam and Eve.</I>
  </P>

  <P>
  <SUP>1</SUP> But when the wily Satan saw them, that they were going to
   the garden, he gathered together his host, and came in
   appearance upon a cloud, intent on deceiving them.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>2</SUP> But when Adam and Eve saw him thus in a vision, they
   thought they were angels of God come to comfort them about
   their having left the garden, or to bring them back again
   into it.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>3</SUP> And Adam spread his hands unto God, beseeching Him to
   make him understand what they were.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>4</SUP> Then Satan, the hater of all good, said unto Adam, "0 Adam,
   I am an angel of the great God; and, behold the hosts that
   surround me.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>5</SUP> "God has sent me and them to take thee and bring thee to
   the border of the garden northwards; to the shore of the
   clear sea, and bathe thee and Eve in it, and raise you to your
   former gladness, that ye return again to the garden."
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>6</SUP> These words sank into the heart of Adam and Eve.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>7</SUP> Yet God withheld His Word from Adam, and did not make
   him understand at once, but waited to see his strength;
   whether he would be overcome as Eve was when in the garden,
   or whether he would prevail.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>8</SUP> Then Satan called to Adam and Eve, and said, "Behold, we
   go to the sea of water," and they began to go.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>9</SUP> And Adam and Eve followed them at some little distance.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>10</SUP> But when they came to the mountain to the north of the garden,
   a very high mountain, without any steps to the top of it, the
   Devil* drew near to Adam and Eve, and made them go up to
   the top in reality, and not in a vision; wishing, as he did, to
   throw them down and kill them, and to wipe off their name
   from the earth; so that this earth should remain to him and
   his hosts alone.
  </P><BR>

 
  <P>
    <H3>CHAPTER 29</H3>
  </P>

  <P>
  <SUP>1</SUP> But when the merciful God saw that Satan wished to kill
   Adam with his manifold devices, and saw that Adam was meek
   and without guile, God spake unto Satan in a loud voice, and
   cursed him.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>2</SUP> Then he and his hosts fled, and Adam and Eve remained
   standing on the top of the mountain, whence they saw below
   them the wide world, high above which they were. But they
   saw none of the host which anon were by them.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>3</SUP> They wept, both Adam and Eve, before God, and begged for
   forgiveness of Him.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>4</SUP> Then came the Word from God to Adam, and said unto him,
   "Know thou and understand concerning this Satan, that he
   seeks to deceive thee and thy seed after thee."
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>5</SUP> And Adam wept before the Lord God, and begged and
   entreated Him to give him something from the garden, as a
   token to him, wherein to be comforted.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>6</SUP> And God looked upon Adam's thought, and sent the angel
   Michael as far as the sea that reaches unto India, to take from
   thence golden rods and bring them to Adam.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>7</SUP> This did God in His wisdom, in order that these golden
   rods, being with Adam in the cave, should shine forth with
   light in the night around him, and put an end to his fear of
   the darkness.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>8</SUP>Then the angel Michael went down by God's order, took
   golden rods, as God had commanded him, and brought them
   to God.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
    <H3>CHAPTER 30</H3>
  </P>

  <P>
  <SUP>1</SUP> After these things, God commanded the angel Gabriel to
   go down to the garden, and say to the cherub who kept it,
   "Behold, God has commanded me to come into the garden,
   and to take thence sweet smelling incense, and give it to
   Adam."
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>2</SUP> Then the angel Gabriel went down by God's order to the
   garden, and told the cherub as God had commanded him.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>3</SUP> The cherub then said, "Well." And [Gabriel] went in and
   took the incense.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>4</SUP> Then God commanded His angel Raphael to go down to the
   garden, and speak to the cherub about some myrrh, to give to
   Adam.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>5</SUP> And the angel Raphael went down and told the cherub as
   God had commanded him, and the cherub said, "Well." Then
   [Raphael] went in and took the myrrh.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>6</SUP> The golden rods were from the Indian sea, where there are
   precious stones. The incense was from the eastern border of
   the garden; and the myrrh from the western border, whence
   bitterness came upon Adam.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>7</SUP> And the angels brought these three things to God, by the
   Tree of Life, in the garden.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>8</SUP> Then God said to the angels, "Dip them in the spring of
   water; then take them and sprinkle their water over Adam
   and Eve, that they be a little comforted in their sorrow, and
   give them to Adam and Eve.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>9</SUP> And the angels did as God had commanded them, and they
   gave all those things to Adam and Eve on the top of the
   mountain upon which Satan had placed them, when he sought
   to make an end of them.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>10</SUP> And when Adam saw the golden rods, the incense and the
   myrrh, he was rejoiced and wept because he thought that the
   gold was a token of the kingdom whence he had come, that the
   incense was a token of the bright light which had been taken
   from him, and that the myrrh was a token of the sorrow in
   which he was.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
    <H3>CHAPTER 31</H3>
  </P>

  <P>
  <SUP>1</SUP> After these things God said unto Adam, "Thou didst ask
   of Me something from the garden, to be comforted therewith,
   and I have given thee these three tokens as a consolation to
   thee; that thou trust in Me and in My covenant with thee.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>2</SUP> "For I will come and save thee; and kings*<SUP>33</SUP> shall bring me
   [when] in the flesh, gold, incense and myrrh; gold as a token
   of My kingdom;&dagger; incense as a token of My divinity; and
   myrrh as a token of My sufferings and of My death.<SUP>34</SUP>
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>3</SUP> "But, Adam, put these by thee in the cave; the gold that
   it may shed light over thee by night; the incense, that thou
   smell its sweet savour; and the myrrh, to comfort thee in thy
   sorrow."
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>4</SUP> When Adam heard these words from God, he worshipped
   before Him. He and Eve worshipped Him and gave Him
   thanks, because He had dealt mercifully with them.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>5</SUP> Then God commanded the three angels, Michael, Gabriel
   and Raphael, each to bring what he had brought, and give it to
   Adam. And they did so, one by one.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>6</SUP> And God commanded Suriyel and Salathiel to bear up Adam
   and Eve, and bring them down from the top of the high
   mountain, and to take them to the Cave of Treasures.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>7</SUP> There they laid the gold on the south side of the cave, the
   incense on the eastern side, and the myrrh on the western side.
   For the mouth of the cave was on the north side.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>8</SUP> The angels then comforted Adam and Eve, and departed.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>9</SUP> The gold was seventy rods; the incense, twelve pounds;
   and the myrrh, three pounds.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>10</SUP> These remained by Adam in the House&ddagger; of Treasures; therefore
   was it called "of concealment." But other interpreters
   say it was called the "Cave of Treasures," by reason of the
   bodies of righteous men that were in it.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>11</SUP> These three things did God give to Adam, on the third day
   after he had oome out of the garden, in token of the three days
   the Lord should remain in the heart of the earth.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>12</SUP> And these three things, as they continued with Adam in the
   cave, gave him light by night ; and by day they gave him a
   little relief from his sorrow.**
  </P><BR>

   <P>
    <H3>CHAPTER 32</H3>
  </P>

  <P>
  <SUP>1</SUP> And Adam and Eve remained in the Cave of Treasures until
   the seventh day; they neither ate of the fruit of the earth, nor
   drank water.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>2</SUP> And when it dawned on the eighth day, Adam said to Eve,
   "Eve, we prayed God to give us somewhat from the garden,
   and He sent His angels who brought us what we had desired.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>3</SUP> "But now, arise, let us go to the sea of water we saw at
   first, and let us stand in it, praying that God will again be
   favourable to us and take us back to the garden; or give us
   something; or that He will give us comfort in some other land
   than this in which we are."
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>4</SUP> Then Adam and Eve came out of the cave, went and stood
   on the border of the sea in which they had before thrown
   themselves, and Adam said to Eve:--
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>5</SUP> "Come, go down into this place, and come not out of it until
   the end of thirty days, when I shall come to thee. And pray to
   God with a fervent heart and a sweet voice, to forgive us.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>6</SUP> "And I will go to another place, and go down into it, and
   do like thee."
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>7</SUP> Then Eve went down into the water, as Adam had commanded
   her. Adam also went down into the water; and they
   stood praying; and besought the Lord to forgive them their
   offence, and to restore them to their former state.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
  <SUP>8</SUP> And they stood thus praying, unto the end of the
   five-and-thirty days.
  </P><BR>

  <P>
    <H3>CHAPTER 33</H3>
    Third apparition of Satan to Adam and Eve. 
  </P>


<P>
<SUP>1</SUP>But Satan, the hater of all good, sought them in the cave,
 but found them not, although he searched diligently for them.
</P><BR>

<P>
<SUP>2</SUP>But he found them standing in the water praying, and
thought within himself, " Adam and Eve are thus standing in
that water beseeching Grod to forgive them their transgression,
and to restore them to their former estate, and to take them
from under my hand.
</P><BR>

<P>
<SUP>3</SUP>" But I will deceive them so that they shall come out of the
water, and not fulfil their vow.^^*
</P><BR>

<P>
<SUP>4</SUP>Then the hater of all good, went not to Adam, but he went
to Eve, and took the form of an angel of God, praising and
rejoicing, and said to her : —
</P><BR>

<P>
<SUP>5</SUP>" Peace be unto thee ! Be glad and rejoice ! God is favour-
able unto you, and He sent me to Adam. I have brought him
the glad tidings of salvation, and of his being filled with bright
light as he was at first.
</P><BR>

</P>
<SUP>6</SUP>" And Adam, in his joy for his restoration, has sent me to
thee, that thou come to me, in order that I crown thee with
light like him. And he said to me, ^ Speak unto Eve ; if
she does not come with thee, tell her of the sign when we
were on the top of the mountain; how God sent His angels
who took us and brought us to the Cave of Treasures; and
laid the gold on the southern side ; incense, on the eastern
side; and myrrh on the western side.' Now come to him."
</P><BR>

<P>
<SUP>7</SUP>When Eve heard these words from him, she rejoiced greatly.
And thinking that [Satan's] appearancef was real, she came
out of the sea.
</P><BR>

<P>
<SUP>8</SUP>He went before, and she followed him until they came to
Adam. Then Satan hid himself from her, and she saw him no
more.
</P><BR>

<P>  
<SUP>9</SUP>She then came and stood before Adam, who was standing by
the water and rejoicing in God's forgiveness.
</P><BR>

<P>
<SUP>10</SUP>And as she called to him, he turned round, found her [there]
and wept when he saw her, and smote upon his breast ; and
from the bitterness* of his grief, he sank into the water.
</P><BR>

<P>
<SUP>11</SUP>But God looked upon him and upon his misery, and upon
his being about to breathe his last. And the Word of God
came from heaven, raised him out of the water, and said unto
him, '' Go up the high bank to Eve." And when he came up
to Eve he said unto her, '' Who said to thee ' come hither ? ' "
</P><BR>

<P>
<SUP>12</SUP>Then she told him the discourse of the angel who had
appeared unto her and had given her a sign.
</P><BR>

<P>
<SUP>13</SUP>But Adam grieved, and gave her to know it was Satan. He
then took her and they both returned to the cave.
</P><BR>

<P>
<SUP>14</SUP>These things happened to them the second time they went
down to the water, seven days after their coming out of the
garden.
</P><BR>

<P>
<SUP>15</SUP>They fasted in the water thirty-five days ; altogether forty-
two days since they had left the garden.^^
</P><BR>


<P>
<H3>CHAPTER 34</H3>
</P>

<P>
And on the morning of the forty-third day, they came out of
the cave, sorrowful and weeping. Their bodies were lean, and
they were parched from hunger and thirst, from fasting and
praying, and from their heavy sorrow on account of their
transgression.
</P><BR>

<P>
And when they had come out of the cave they went up the
mountain to the west of the garden.
</P><BR>

<P>
There they stood and prayed and besought God to grant
them forgiveness of their sins.
</P><BR>

<P>
ADAM'S PRAYER
<BR>
And after their prayers Adam began to entreat God, saying,
<BR>
" O my Lord, my God, and my Creator, Thou didst command
the four elements to be gathered together,* and they were
gathered together by Thine order.
<BR>
'' Then Thou spreadest Thy hand and didst create me out of
one element, that of dust of the earth ; and Thou didst bring
me into the garden at the third hour, on a Friday, and didst
inform me of it in the cave.
<BR>
" Then, at first, I knew neither night nor day, for I had a
bright nature ; neither did the light in which I lived ever leave
me to know night or day.
<BR>
"Then, again, Lord, in that third hour in which Thou
didst create me. Thou broughtest to me all beasts, and lions,
and ostriches, and fowls of the air, and all things that move
in the earth, which Thou hadst created at the first hour [before
me] of the Friday.
<BR>
"And Thy will was that I should name them all, one
by one, with a suitable name. But Thou gavest me under-
standing and knowledge, and a pure heart and a right min'^
from Thee, that I should name them after Thine own mind
regarding [the naming of them] .

that not one of them break from my sway, according to Thy
commandment, and to the dominion which Thou hast given
me over them. Bat now they are all estranged from me.

" Then it was in that third hour of Friday, in which Thou
didst create me, and didst command me concerning the tree,
to which I was neither to draw near, nor to eat thereof ; for
Thou saidst to me in the garden, ' When thou eatest of it, of
death thou shalt die.'
<BR>
" And if Thou hadst punishedf me as Thou saidst, with
death, I should have died that very moment. J
<BR>
" Moreover, when Thou commandedst me regarding the tree,
I was neither to approach nor to eat thereof, Eve was not with
me ; Thou hadst not yet created her, neither hadst Thou yet
taken her out of my side ; nor had she yet heard this order
from Thee.
<BR>
" Then, at the end of the third hour of that Friday, O Lord,
Thou didst cause a slumber and a sleep to come over me, and
I slept, and was overwhelmed in sleep.
<BR>
" Then Thou didst draw a rib out of my side, and created it
after my own similitude and image. Then I awoke; and
when I saw her and knew who she was, I said, * This is bone
of my bones, and flesh of my flesh ; henceforth she shall be
called woman.'
<BR>
** It was of Thy good will, O God, that Thou broughtest a
slumber and a sleep over me, and [that Thou] didst forthwith
bring Eve out of my side, until she was out, so that I did not
see how she was made ; neither could I witness, O my Lord,
how awful and great are Thy goodness and glory.
<BR>
" And of Thy goodwill, O Lord, Thou madest us both with
bodies of a bright nature, and Thou madest us two, one ; and
Thou gavest us Thy grace, and didst fill* us with praises of
the Holy Spirit ; that we should be neither hungry nor thirsty,
nor know what sorrow is, nor [yet] f aintness of heart ; neither
suffering, fasting, nor weariness.

" But now, God, since we transgressed Thy commandment
and broke Thy law, Thou hast brought us out into a strange
land, and has caused sufiering, and faintness, hunger and
thirst to come upon us.

to eat from the garden,^^ to satisfy our hunger with it j and
something wherewith to quench our thirst.

Then God looked again upon Adam and his weeping and
groaning, and the Word of God came to him, and said unto
him : 
</P><BR>

<P>
" Adam, when thou wast in My garden, thou knewest
neither eating nor drinking ; neither faintness nor suffering ;

into this strange land, all these trials are come upon thee.

Then God commanded the cherub, who kept the gate of the
garden with a sword of fire in his hand, to take some of the
fruit of the fig-tree, and to give it to Adam.

The cherub obeyed the command of the Lord God, and
went into the garden and brought two figs on* two twigs, each
fig hanging to its leaf; they were from two of the trees among
which Adam and Eve hid themselves when God went to walk

in the garden, and the Word of God came to Adam and Eve
and said unto them, " Adam, Adam, where art thou V And
Adam answered, " God, here am I. I hid myself among
fig-trees ; and when I heard the sound of Thee and Thy voice,
I hid myself, because I am naked."

Then the cherub took two figs and brought them to Adam
and to Eve. But he threw them to them from afar ; for they
might not come near the cherub by reason of their flesh, that
could DOt come near the fire.

At first, angels trembled at the presence of Adam and were
afraid of him.* But now Adam trembled before the angels and
was afraid of them.

Then Adam drew near and took one fig, and Eve also came
in turn and took the other.

And as they took them up in their hands, they looked at
them, and knew they were from the trees among which they
had hidden themselves.

And Adam and Eve wept sore.

CHAPTER XXXVII.

Then Adam said to Eve, " Seest thou not these figs and
their leaves, with which we covered ourselves when we were
stripped of our bright nature ? But now, we know not what
misery and suffering may come upon us from eating them.

"Now, therefore, Eve, let us restrain ourselves and not
eat of them, thou and I ; and let us ask God to give us of the
fruit of the Tree of Life.''

Thus did Adam and Eve restrain themselves, and did not
eat of those figs.

But Adam began to pray to God and to beseech Him to
give him of the fruit of the Tree of Life, saying thus : " O
God, when we transgressed Thy commandment at the sixth

hour of Friday, we were stripped of the bright nature we had,"
and did not continue in the garden after our transgression,
more than three hours.

''But on the evening Thou madest us come out of it.
God, we transgressed against Thee one hour, and all these
trials and sorrows have come upon us until this day.

" And those days together with this the forty-third day, do
not redeem* that one hour in which we transgressed !

*' God, look upon us with an eye of pity, and do not
requite us according to our transgression of Thy command-
ment, in presence of Thee.

" O God, give us of the fruit of the Tree of Life, that we
may eat of it, and live, and turn not to see sufferings and other
[trouble], in this earth; for Thou art God.

" When we transgressed Thy commandment. Thou madest
us come out of the garden, and didst send a cherub to keep the
Tree of Life, lest we should eat thereof, and live ; and know
nothing of faintness after we transgressed.

" But now, Lord, behold, we have endured all these days,
and have borne sufferings. Make these forty-three days an
equivalentf for the one hour in which we transgressed.



CHAPTER XXXVIII.

After these things the Word of God came to Adam, and
said unto him : —

" O Adam, as to the fruit of the Tree of Life, for which thou
askest, I will not give it thee now, but when the 5500 years
are fulfilled. Then will I give thee of the fruit of the Tree of
Life, and thou shalt eat, and live for ever, thou, and Eve, and
thy righteous seed.

* Or, make up for. f Even with.



42 TEE BOOK OF ADAM AND EVE. [book

" But these forty-three days cannot make amends* for the
hour in which thou didst transgress My commandment.

" Adam, I gave thee to eat of the fig-tree in which thou
didst hide thyself. Go and eat of it, thou and Eve.

" I will not deny t thy request, neither will I disappoint thy
hope ; therefore, bear up unto the fulfilment of the covenant
I made with thee.''

And God withdrew His Word from Adam.



CHAPTER XXXIX.

Then Adam returned to Eve, and said to her, *' Arise, and
take a fig for thyself, and I will take another; and let us go to
our cave.''

Then Adam and Eve took [each a fig] and went towards the
cave j the time was about the setting of the sun ; and their
thoughts made them long to eat of the fruit.

But Adam said to Eve, " I am afraid to eat of this fig. I
know not what may come upon me from it."

So Adam wept, and stood praying before God, saying,
" Satisfy my hunger, without my having to eat this fig ; for
after I have eaten it, what will it profit me ? And what shall
I desire and ask of Thee, God, when it is gone ? "

And he said again, " I am afraid to eat of it ; for I know
not what will befall me through it."

CHAPTER XL.

Then the Word of God came to Adam, and said unto him,
" O Adam, why hadst thou not this dread, neither this fasting,
nor this care ere this ? And why hadst thou not this fear
before thou didst transgress ?

* Or, redeem. f Or, reject, turn back.



I.] GOD GIVES THEM TWO FIGS. 43

" But when thou earnest to dwell in this strange land, thy
animal body could not be on earth without earthly food, to
strengthen it and to restore its powers/^

And God withdrew His Word from Adam.



CHAPTER XLI.

Then Adam took the fig, and laid it on the golden rods.
Eve also took [her] fig, and put it upon the incense.'®

And the weight of each fig was that of a water-melon ; for
the fruit of the garden was much larger than the fruit of this
land.

But Adam and Eve remained standing and fasting the
whole of that night, until the morning dawned.

WTien the sun rose they were at their prayers, and Adam
said to Eve, after they had done praying : —

" Eve, come, let us go to the border of the garden looking
south ; to the place whence the river flows, and is parted into
four heads.* There we will pray to God, and ask Him to give
us to drink of the Water of Life.

" For God has not fed us with the Tree of Life, in order
that we may not live. We will, therefore, ask Him to give us
of the Water of Life, and to quench our thirst with it, rather
than with a drink of water of this land.^'f

When Eve heard these words from Adam, she agreed ; and
they both arose and came to the southern border of the
garden, upon the brink of the river of water at some little
distance from the garden.

And they stood and prayed before the Lord, and asked Him

to look upon them this once, to forgive them, and to grant

them their request.

* Or, streams.

t As read by Dillmann, it may also mean, that we may do without the water
of this land — or, of this earth.



44 THE BOOK OF ADAM AND EVE. [book

After this prayer from both of them, Adam began [to pray]
with [his] voice before God, and said : —

" Lord, when I was in the garden and saw the water that
flowed from under the Tree of Life, my heart did not desire,
neither did my body require to drink of it ; neither did I know
thirst, for I was living ; and above that which I am now.

" So that in order to live I did not require any Food of Life,
neither did I drink of the Water of Life.

" But now, God, I am dead ; my flesh is parched with
thirst. Give me of the Water of Life that I may drink of it
and live.

" Of Thy mercy, God, save me from these plagues and
trials, and bring me into another land different from this, if
Thou wilt not let me dwell in Thy garden.*'



CHAPTER XLII.

Then came the Word of God to Adam, and said unto him : —

*' Adam, as to what thou sayest, ' Bring me into a land
where there is rest,' it is not another land than this, but it is
the kingdom of heaven where [alone] there is rest.

" But thou canst not make thy entrance into it at present ;
but [only] after thy judgment* is past and fulfilled.

" Then will I make thee go up into the kingdom of heaven,
tbee and thy righteous seed ; and I will give thee and them
the rest thou askest for at present.

" And if thou saidst, ' Give me of the Water of Life that I
may drink and live ' — it cannot be this day, but on the day
that I shall descend into hell, and break the gates of brass, and
bruise in pieces the kingdoms of iron.

" Then will I in mercy save thy soul and the souls of the
righteous, [to give them] rest in My garden. And that shall
be when the end of the world is come.

* i.e., thy sentence — or, panishment.



T.] FOURTH APPABJTION OF SATAN. 45

" And, again, as regards the Water of Life thou seekest, it
will not be granted thee this day ; but on the day that I shall
shed My blood upon thy head in the land of Golgotha.

" For My blood shall be the Water of Life unto thee, at that
time, and not to thee alone, but unto all those of thy seed who
shall believe in Me ; that it be unto them for rest for ever."

The Lord said again unto Adam, " O Adam, when thou wast
in the garden, these trials did not come to thee.

*'But since thou didst transgress My commandment, all
these sufferings have come upon thee.

" Now, also, does thy flesh require food and drink ; drink
[then] of that water that flows by thee on the face of the
earth."

Then God withdrew His Word from Adam.

And Adam and Eve worshipped the Lord, and returned
from the river of water to the cave. It was noon-day ; and
when they drew near to the cave, they saw a large fire by it.



CHAPTER XLIIL

Fourth apparition of Satan to Adam and Eve.

Then Adam and Eve were afraid, and stood still. And Adam
said to Eve, " What is that fire by our cave ? We do nothing
in it to bring about this fire.

" We neither have bread to bake therein, nor broth* to cook
there. As to this fire, we know not the like, neither do we
know what to call it.

" But ever since God sent the cherub with a sword of fire
that flashed and lightened in his hand, from fear of which we
fell down and were like corpses [have we not seen the like].

" But now, O Eve, behold, this is the same fire that was in

* Or, soup, mess, cooking.



46 THE BOOK OF ADAM AND EVE. [book

the cherub's hand, which God has sent to keep the cave in
which we dwell.

" Eve, [it is] because God is angry with us, and will drive
us from it.

" Eve, we have again transgressed [His] commandment in
that cave, so that He has sent this fire to [burn] around it, and
to prevent us from going into it.*

" If this be really so, Eve, where shall we dwell ? and
whither shall we flee from before the face of the Lord ? Since,
as regards the garden. He will not let us abide in it, and He
has deprived us of the good things thereof ; but He has placed
us in this cave, in which we have borne darkness, trials and
hardships, until [at last] we found comfort therein.

*' But now that He has brought us out into another land, who
knows what may happen in it ? And who knows but that the
darkness of that land may be far greater than the darkness of
this land ?

'' Who knows what may happen in that land by day or by
night ? And who knows whether it will be far or near, Eve ?
Where it will please God to put us, [may be] far from the
garden, Eve ! or where God will prevent us from beholding
Him, because we have transgressed His commandment, and
because we have made requests unto Him at all times ?

" Eve, if God will bring us into a strange land other than
this, in which we find consolation, it must be to put our soulsf
to death, and blot out our name from the face of the earth.

" Eve, if we are farther estranged from the garden and from
God, where shall we find Him again, and ask Him to give us
gold, incense, myrrh, and some fruit of the fig-tree ?

" Where shall we find Him, to comfort us a second time ?
Where shall we find Him, that He may think of us, as regards
the covenant He has made on our behalf?" J

* Or, and He will not let us enter into it.
t Or, " us," X Or, " the promise He has made us."



I.] SATAN TRIES TO BURN TEE CAVE. 47

Then Adam said no more. And they kept looking, he and
Ere, towards the cave, and at the fire that flared up around it.

But that fire was from Satan. For he had gathered trees
and dry grasses, and had carried and brought them to the cave,
and had set fire to them, in order to consume the cave and
what was in it.

So that Adam and Eve should be left in sorrow, and he
should cut off their trust in Grod, and make them deny Him.

But by the mercy of God he could not burn the cave,* for
God sent His angel round the cave to guard it from such a fire,
until it went out.

And this fire lasted from noon- day until the break of day.
That was the forty-fifth day.



CHAPTER XLIV.

• Yet Adam and Eve were standing and looking at the fire, and
unable to come near the cave from their dread of the fire.

And Satan kept on bringing trees and throwing them into
the fire, until the flame thereof rose up on high, and covered
the whole cave, thinking, as he did in his own mind, to consume
the cave with much fire. But the angel of the Lord was
guarding it.

And yet he could not curse Satan, nor injure him by word,
because he had no authority over him, neither did he take to
doing so with words from his mouth.

Therefore did the angel bear with him, without saying one
bad word, until the Word of God came who said to Satan, " Go
hence ; once before didst thou deceive My servants, and this
time thou seekest to destroy them.

" Were it not for My mercy I would have destroyed thee

♦ The Arabic here adds, " for God defeated the thoughts of that deceiver, so
that the fire did not hurt the care ; but the angel," &c.



48 THE BOOK OF ADAM AND EVE. [book

and tliy hosts from off the earth. But I have had patience
with thee,* unto the end of the world."

Then Satan fled from before the Lord. But the fire went
on burning around the cave like a coal-fire the whole day ;
which was the forty -sixth day Adam and Eve had spent since
they came out of the garden.

And when Adam and Eve saw that the heat of the fire had
somewhat cooled down, they began to walk towards the cave to
get into it as they were wont ; but thfey could not, by reason
of the heat of the fire.

Then they both took to weeping because of the fire that
made separation between them and the cave, and that drew
towards them, burning. And they were afraid.

Then Adam said to Eve, " See this fire of which we have a
portion in us : which formerly yielded to us, but no longer
does so, now that we have transgressed the limit of creation,
and changed our condition, and our nature is altered. But the
fire is not changed in its nature, nor altered from its creation.
Therefore has it now power over us ; and when we come near
it, it scorches our flesh."



CHAPTER XLV.

Then Adam rose and prayed unto God, saying, " See, this
fire has made separation between us and the cave in which
Thou hast commanded us to dwell; but now, behold, we
cannot go into it."

Then God heard Adam, and sent him His Word, that said : —

" Adam, see this fire ! how [different] the flame and heat
thereof are from the garden of delights and the good things
in it !

" When thou wast under My control, all creatures yielded to

* Or, " respited thee."



I.] GOD SPEAKS TO ADAM. 49

thee ; but after thou hast transgressed My commandment, they
all rise over thee."

Again said God unto him, " See, O Adam, how Satan has
exalted thee ! He has deprived thee of the Godhead, and of
an exalted state like unto Me, and has not kept his word to
thee ; but, after all, is become thy foe. It is he who made this
fire in which he meant to bum thee and Eve.

" Why, O Adam, has he not kept his agreement with thee,
not even one day ; but has deprived thee of the glory that was
on thee — when thou didst yield to his command ?

" Thinkest thou, Adam, that he loved thee when he made
this agreement with thee ? Or, that he loved thee and wished
to raise thee on high ?

" But no, Adam, he did not do all that out of love to thee ;
but he wished to make thee come out of light into darkness ;
and from an exalted state to degradation ; from glory to
abasement ; from joy to sorrow ; and from rest to fasting and
fainting."

God said also to Adam, '* See this fire kindled by Satan
around thy cave ; see this wonder that surrounds thee ; and
know that it will encompass about both thee and thy seed, when
ye hearken to his behest ; that he will plague you with fire ;
and that ye shall go down into hell after ye are dead.

'' Then shall ye see the burning of his fire, that will thus be
burning around you and your seed. There shall be no deliver-
ance from it for you, but at My coming ; in like manner as thou
canst not now go into thy cave, by reason of the great fire
[around it] ; [not] until My Word shall come that will make a
way for thee on the day My covenant is fulfilled.

" There is no way for thee at present to come from hence to

rest, not until My Word comes, who is My Word.* Then

will He make a way for thee, and thou shalt have rest." Then

God called with His Word to that fire that burned around the

* The Arabic original here reads more definitely: " not until My voice comes,
which is My Won)," i.e., God speaking to us through His Son.

4



50 THE BOOK OF ADAM AND EVE. [book

cave, that it part itself asunder, until Adam had gone through
it. Then the fire parted itself by God's order, and a way was
made for Adam.

And God withdrew His Word from Adam.



CHAPTER XL VI.

Then Adam and Eye began again to come into the cave.

And when they came to the way between the fire, Satan
blew into the fire like a whirlwind, and made on Adam and
and Eve a burning coal-fire ; so that their bodies were singed ;
and the coal- fire scorched them.

And from the burning of the fire Adam and Eve cried aloud,
and said, " Lord, save us ! Leave us not to be consumed
and plagued by this burning fire ; neither requite us for having
transgressed Thy commandment.''

Then God looked upon their bodies, on which Satan had
caused fire to burn, and God sent His angel that stayed the
burning fire. But the wounds remained on their bodies.

And God said unto Adam, " See Satan's love for thee, who
pretended to give thee the Godhead and greatness ; and, behold,
he burns thee with fire, and seeks to destroy thee from off the
earth.

" Then look at Me, Adam ; I created thee, and how many
times have I delivered thee out of his hand ? If not, would he
not have destroyed thee ?

God said again to Eve, " What is that he promised thee in
the garden, saying, ' At the time ye shall eat of the tree, your
eyes will be opened, and you shall become hke gods, knowing
good and evil.' But lo ! he has burnt your bodies with fire, and
has made you taste the taste of fire, for the taste of the garden;
and has made you see the burning of fire, and the evil thereof,
»nd the power it has over you.



I.] TEEY RETURN TO THE GAVE. 51

" Your eyes have seen the good he has taken from you, and
in truth he has opened your eyes; and you have seen the
garden in which ye were with Me, and ye have also seen the
evil that has come upon you from Satan. But as to the God-
head he cannot give it you, neither fulfil his speech to you.
Nay, he was bitter against you and your seed, that will come
after you."

And God withdrew His Word from them.



CHAPTER XLYII.

Then Adam and Eve came into the cave, yet trembling at
the fire that had scorched their bodies. So Adam said to Eve : —

'^ Lo, the fire has burnt our flesh in this world ; but how
will it be when we are dead, and Satan shall punish* our souls ?
Is not our deliverance long and far off, unless God come, and in
mercy to us fulfil His promise ? "

Then Adam and Eve passed into the cave, blessing them-
selves for coming into it once more. For it was in their
thoughts, that they never should enter it, when they saw the
fire around it.

But as the sun was setting the fire was [still] burning and
nearing Adam and Eve in the cave, so that they could not
sleep in it. After the sun had set, they went out of it. This
was the forty-seventh day after they came out of the garden.

Adam and Eve then came under the top of hill by f the garden
to sleep, as they were wont.

And they stood and prayed God to forgive them their sins,
and then fell asleep under the summit of the mountain.

But Satan, the hater of all good, thought within himself :
Whereas God has promised salvation to Adam by covenant,
and that He would deliver him out of all the hardships that

have befallen him — but has not promised me by covenant, and
will not deliver me out of [my] hardships ; nay, since He has
promised him that He should make him and his seed dwell in
the kingdom in which I [once] was — I will kill Adam. The
earth shall be rid of him ; and shall be left to me alone j so
that when he is dead he may not have any seed left to inherit
the kingdom that shall remain my own realm ; God will then be
in want of me, and He will restore me to it with my hosts.



CHAPTER XLVIII.

Fifth apparition of Satan to Adam and Eve.

After this Satan called to his hosts, all of which came to
him, and said unto him : —

" 0, our Lord, what wilt thou do ? "

He then said unto them, " Ye know that this Adam, whom
God created out of the dust, is he who has taken our kingdom.
Come, let us gather together and kill him ; or hurl a rock at
him and at Eve, and crush them under it."

When Satan's hosts heard these words, they came to the
part of the mountain where Adam and Eve were asleep.

Then Satan and his hosts took a huge rock, broad and even,
and without blemish, thinking within himself, " If there should
be a hole in the rock, when it fell on them, the hole in the rock
might come upon them, and so they would escape and not die."

He then said to his hosts, " Take up this stone, and throw it
flat upon them, so that it roll not from them to somewhere
else. And when ye have hurled it, flee and tarry not." And
they did as he bid them. But as the rock fell down from the
mountain upon Adam and Eve, God commanded it to become
a kind of shed over them, that did them no harm. And so it
was by God's order.



I.] ADAM AND EVE UNDER TEE ROOK. 53

But when the rock fell, the whole earth quaked with it, and
was shaken from the size of the rock.

And as it quaked and shook, Adam and Eve awoke from
sleep, and found themselves under a rock like a shed.* But
they knew not how it was ; for [when they fell asleep] they
were under the sky, and not under a shed ; and when they saw
it, they were afraid.

^ Then Adam said to Eve, "Wherefore has the mountain
bent [itself], and the earth quaked and shaken on our account?
And why has this rock spread itself over us like a tent ?

" Does God intend to plague us and to shut us up in this
prison ? Or will He close the earth upon us ?

" He is angry with us for our having come out of the cave,
without His order ; and for our having done so of our own
accord, without consulting Him, when we left the cave and
came to this place.''

Then Eve said, " If, indeed, the earth quaked for our sake,
and this rock forms a tent over us because of our transgres-
sion, then woe be to us, Adam, for our punishment will be
long.

" But arise and pray to God to let us know concerning this,
and what this rock is, that is spread over us like a tent."

Then Adam stood up and prayed before the Lord, to let him
know about this strait. And Adam thus stood praying until
the morning.



CHAPTER XLIX.

Then the Word of God came and said : —
" Adam, who counselled thee, when thou camest out of
the cave, to comef to this place ? "

And Adam said unto God, " Lord, we came to this place

* Tent or awning. f Lit. and earnest.



54 TEE BOOK OF ADAM AND EVE. [book

because of the heat of the fire, that came upon us inside the
cave."

Then the Lord God said unto Adam, " O Adam, thou
dreadest the heat of fire for one night, but how will it be
when thou dwellest in hell ?*

" Yet, O Adam, fear not, neither say in thy heart that I have
spread this rock as an awning over thee, to plague thee there-
with.

" It came from Satan, who had promised thee the Godhead
and majesty. It is he who threw down this rock to kill thee
under it, and Eve with thee, and thus to prevent you from
living upon the earth.

" But, in mercy for you, just as that rock was falling down
upon you, I commanded it to form an awning over you ; and
the rock under you, to lower itself.

" And this sign, Adam, will happen to Me at My coming
upon earth : Satan will raise the people of the Jews to put Me
to death ; and they will lay Me in a rock, and seal a large stone
upon Me, and I shall remain within that rock three days and
three nights.

" But on the third day I shall rise again, and it shall be
salvation to thee, O Adam, and to thy seed, to believe in Me.
But, O Adam, I will not bring thee from under this rock until
three days and three nights are passed."

And God withdrew His Word from Adam.

But Adam and Eve abode under the rock three days and
three nights, as God had told them.

And God did so to them because they had left their cave and
had come to this same place without God's order.

But, after three days and three nights, God opened the rock
and brought them out from under it. Their flesh was dried up,
and their eyes and their hearts were troubled from weeping and

I.] ADAM IN SEABGH OF RAIMENT, 55

CHAPTER L.

Then Adam and Eve went forth and came into the Cave of
Treasures, and they stood praying in it the whole of that day,
until the evening.

And this took place at the end of fifty days after they had
left the garden.

But Adam and Eve rose again and prayed to God in the cave
the whole of that night, and begged for mercy from Him.

And when the day dawned, Adam said unto Eve, " Come!
let us go and do some work for our bodies.''

So they went out of the cave, and came to the northern
border of the garden, and they sought something to cover their
bodies withal. But they found nothing, and knew not how to
do the work. Yet their bodies were stained,* and they were
speechless from cold and heat.

Then Adam stood and asked God to show him something
wherewith to cover their bodies.

Then came the Word of God and said unto him, " O Adam,
take Eve and come to the sea-shore, where ye fasted before.
There ye shall find skins of sheep, whose flesh was devoured
by lions, and whose skins were left. Take them and make
raiment for yourselves, and clothe yourselves withal.



CHAPTER LI.

When Adam heard these words from God, he took Eve and
removed from the northern end of the garden to the south of
it, by the river of water, where they [once] fasted.

But as they were going in the way, and before they reached
that place, Satan the wicked one, had heard the Word of God
communing with Adam respecting his covering.

* Lit. dyed.



56 TEE BOOK OF ADAM AND EVE. [book

It grieved him, and he hastened to the place where the
sheep-skins were, with the intention of taking them and
throwing them into the sea, or of burning them with fire, that
Adam and Eve should not find them.

But as he was about to take them, the Word of God came
from heaven, and bound him by the side of those skins until
Adam and Eve came near him. But as they neared him they
were afraid of him, and of his hideous look.

Then came the Word of God to Adam and Eve, and said to
them, " This is he who was hidden in the serpent, and who
deceived you, and stripped you of the garment of light and
glory in which you were.

*' This is he who promised you majesty and divinity. Where,
then, is the beauty that was on him ? Where is his divinity ?
Where is his light ? Where is the glory that rested on him ?

" Now his figure is hideous ; he is become abominable
among angels ; and he has come to be called Satan.

" O Adam, he wished to take from you this earthly garment
of sheepskins, and to destroy it, and not let you be covered
with it.

" What, then, is his beauty that you should have followed
him ? And what have you gained by hearkening to him ? See
his evil works and then look at Me ; at Me, 'your Creator, and
at the good deeds I do you.

" See, I bound him until you came and saw him and beheld
his weakness, that no power is left with him."

And God released him from his bonds.



CHAPTER LII.

After this Adam and Eve said no more, but wept before
God on account of their creation, and of their bodies that
required an earthly covering.



I.] OOD CLOTHES ADAM AND EVE. 57

Then Adam said unto Eve, " O Eve, this [is the] skin of
beasts with which we shall he covered. But when we have
put it on, behold, a token of death shall have come upon us,
inasmuch as the owners of these skins have died, and have
wasted away. So also shall we die, and pass away.*'

Then Adam and Eve took the skins, and went back to the
Cave of Treasures ; aad when in it, they stood and prayed as
they were wont.

And they thought how they could make garments of those
skins ; for they had no skill for it.

Then God sent to them His angel to show them how to work
it out. And the angel said to Adam, " Go forth, and bring
some palm-thorns.' ' Then Adam went out, and brought some,
as the angel had commanded him.

Then the angel began before them to work out the skins,
after the manner of one who prepares a shirt. And he took
the thorns and stuck them into the skins, before their eyes.

Then the angel again stood up and prayed God that the
thorns in those skins should be hidden, so as to be, as it were,
sewn with one thread.

And so it was, by God's order ; they became garments for
Adam and Eve, and He clothed them withal.^^

From that time the nakedness of their bodies was covered
from the sight of each other's eyes.

And this happened at the end of the fifty-first day.

Then when Adam and Eve's bodies were covered, they stood
and prayed, and sought mercy of the Lord, and forgiveness,
and gave Him thanks for that He had had mercy on them, and
had covered their nakedness. And they ceased* not from
prayer the whole of that night.

Then when the morn dawned at the rising of the sun, they
saidt their prayers after their custom ; and then went out of
the cave.

* Lit. moVed. t I^t. prayed.



68 THE BOOK OF ADAM AND EVE. [book

And Adam said unto Eve, " Since we know not what there is
to the westward of this cave, let us go forth and see it to-day."
Then they came forth and went towards the western border.



CHAPTER LIII.

Sixth apparition of Satan to Adam and Eve.

They were not very far from the cave, when Satan came
towards them, and hid himself* between them and the cave,
under the form of two ravenous lions three days [without
food], that came towards Adam and Eve, as if to break them
in pieces and devour them.

Then Adam and Eve wept, and prayed God to deliver them
from their paws.

Then the Word of God came to them, and drove away [the
lions] from them.

And God said unto Adam, " Adam, what seekest thou on
the western border ? And why hast thou left of thine own
accord the eastern border, in which was thy dwelling-place ?

"Now, then, turn back to thy cave, and remain in it, that
Satan do not deceive thee, nor work his purposef upon thee.

" For in this western border, O Adam, there will go from
thee a seed, that shall replenish it ; and that will defile them-
selves with their sins, and with their yielding to the behests of
Satan, and by following his works.

" Therefore will I bring upon them the waters of a flood,
and overwhelm them all. But I will deliver what is left of the
righteous among them ; and I will bring them to a distant land,
and the land in which thou dwellest now shall remain desolate
and without one inhabitant in it."

After God had thus discoursed to them, they went back to

* Arab. " he stepped, or plated himself." t ^)^> counsel.



T.] ADAM MEETS THE CEEBVB. 59

the Cave of Treasures. But their flesh was dried up, and their
strength failed from fasting and praying, and from the sorrow
they felt at having trespassed against God.



CHAPTER LIV.

Then Adam and Eve stood up in the cave and prayed the
whole of that night until the morning dawned. And when
the sun was risen they both went out of the cave ; their heads
wandering from heaviness of sorrow, and they not knowing
whither they went.

And they walked thus unto the southern border of the
garden. And they began to go up that border until they
came to the eastern border [beyond] which there was no
[farther] space.

And the cherub who guarded the garden was standing at
the western gate, and guarding it against Adam and Eve, lest
they should suddenly come into the garden. And the cherub
turned round, as if to put them to death; according to the
commandment God had given him.

When Adam and Eve came to the eastern border of the
garden — thinking in their hearts that the cherub was not
watching — as they were standing by the gate as if wishing to
go in, suddenly came the cherub with a flashing sword of fire
in his hand ; and when he saw them, he went forth to kill
them. For he was afraid lest God should destroy him if they
went into the garden without His order.

And the sword of the cherub seemed to flame afar off. But
when he raised it over Adam and Eve, the flame thereof did
not flash forth. Therefore did the cherub think that God was
favourable to them, and was bringing them back into the
garden. And the cherub stood wondering.

He could not go up to Heaven to ascertain God's order
regarding their getting into the garden ; he therefore abode



60 THE BOOK OF ADAM AND EVE. [book

standing by them, unable as he was to part from them ; for he
was afraid lest they should enter the garden without leave from
God, who [then] would destroy him.

When Adam and Eve saw the cherub coming towards them
with a jQaming sword of fire in his hand, they fell on their faces
from fear, and were as dead.

At that time the heavens and the earth shook ; and other
cherubim came down from heaven to the cherub who guarded
the garden, and saw him amazed and silent.

Then, again, other angels came down nigh unto the place
where Adam and Eve were. They were divided between joy
and sorrow.

They were glad, because they thought that God was favour-
able to Adam, and wished him to return to the garden; and
[wished to] restore him to the gladness he once enjoyed.

But they sorrowed over Adam, because he was fallen like a
dead [man], he and Eve; and they said in their thoughts,
*' Adam has not died in this place ; but God has put him to
death, for his having come to this place, and wishing to get
into the garden without His leave."



CHAPTER LV.

Then came the Word of God to Adam and Eve, and raised
them from their dead state, saying unto them, " Why came ye
up hither ? Do you intend to go into the garden, from which
I brought you out ? It can not be to-day ; but [only] when the
covenant I have made with you is fulfilled."

Then Adam, when he heard the Word of God, and the
fluttering of the angels whom he did not see, but only hear
the sound of them with his ears, he and Eve wept, and said to
the angels : —

" Spirits, who wait upon God, look upon me, and upon my

being unable to see you ! For when I was in my former
bright nature, then I could see you. I sang praises as you do ;
and my heart was far above you.

But now, that I have transgressed, that bright nature is
gone from me, and I am come to this miserable state.* And
now am I come to this, that I cannot see you, and you do not
serve me as you were wont. For I am become animal flesh.

" Yet now, angels of God, ask God with me, to restore me
to that wherein I was formerly ; to rescue me from this misery,
and to remove from me the sentence of death He passed
upon me, for having trespassed against Him."

Then, when the angels heard these words, they all gneved
over him ; and cursed Satan who had beguiled Adam, until he
came from, the garden to misery ; from life to death ; from
peace to trouble ; and from gladness to a strange land.

Then the angels said unto Adam, " Thou didst hearken to
Satan, and didst forsake the Word of God who created thee ;
and thou didst believe that Satan would fulfil all he had
promised thee.

''But now, Adam, we will make known to thee, what
came upon us through him, before his fall from heaven.

" He gathered together his hosts, and deceived them, pro-
mising them to give them a great kingdom, a divine nature ;
and other promises he made them.

" His hosts believed that his word was true, so they yielded
to him, and renounced the glory of God.

" He then sent for us — according to the ordersf in which we
were — to come under his command, and to hearken to his vain
promise. But we would not, and we took not his advice.

" Then after he had fought with God, and had dealt frowardly
with Him, he gathered together his hosts, and made war with
us. And if it had not been for God's strength that was with
us, we could not have prevailed against him to hurl him from
heaven.

♦ Or, figure. t Ranks, or dignities.



62 TEE BOOK OF ADAM AND EVE. [book

" But when he fell from among us, there was great joy in
heaven, because of his going down from us. For had he
continued in heaven, nothing, not even one angel would have
remained in it.

" But God in His mercy, drove him from among us to this
dark earth ; for he had become darkness itself and a worker of
unrighteousness.

" And he has continued, Adam, to make war against thee,
until he beguiled thee and made thee come out of the garden,
to this strange land, where all these trials have come to thee.
And death, which God brought upon him he has also brought
to thee, Adam, because thou didst obey him, and didst
transgress against God.*'

Then all the angels rejoiced and praised God; and asked
Him not to destroy Adam this time, for his having sought to
enter the garden ; but to bear with him until the fulfilment of
the promise ; and to help him in this world until he was free
from Satan's hand.



CHAPTEE LVI.

Then came the Word of God to Adam, and said unto him : —

" O Adam, look at that garden of joy and at this earth of
toil, and behold the angels who are in the garden — that is full
of them, and [see] thyself alone on this earth, with Satan whom
thou didst obey.

" Yet, if thou hadst submitted, and been obedient to Me, and
hadst kept My "Word, thou wouldst be with My angels in My
garden.

" But when thou didst transgress and hearken to Satan, thou
didst become his guest among his angels, that are full of
wickedness ; and thou earnest to this earth, that brings forth
to thee thorns and thistles.



I.] GOB SPEAKS TO ADAM. 63

" Adam, ask him who deceived thee, to give thee the divine
nature he promised thee, or to make thee a garden as I had
made for thee ; or to fill thee with that same bright nature with
which I had filled thee.

" [Ask him] to make thee a body like the one I made thee,
or to give thee a day of rest as I gave thee ; or to create within
thee a reasonable soul, as I did create for thee ; or to remove
thee hence to some other earth than this one which I gave thee.
But, Adam, he will not fulfil even one of the things he told
thee.

" Acknowledge, then. My favour towards thee, and My mercy
on thee. My creature ; that I have not requited thee for thy
transgression against Me, but in My pity for thee I have
promised thee that at the end of the great five days and a half
I will come and save thee.'*

Then God said again to Adam and Eve, ''Arise, go down
hence, lest the cherub with a sword of fire in his hand destroy

you."

But Adam's heart was comforted by God's words to him, and
he worshipped before Him.

And God commanded His angels to escort Adam [and Eve]
to the cave with joy, instead of the fear that had come upon
them.

Then the angels took up Adam and Eve, and brought them
down from the mountain by the garden, with songs and psalms,
until they brought them to the cave. There the angels began
to comfort and to strengthen them, and then departed from
them towards heaven, to their Creator, who had sent them.

But, after the angels were gone from Adam and Eve, came
Satan, with shamefacedness, and stood at the entrance of the
cave in which were Adam and Eve. He then called to Adam,
and said, " Adam, come, let me speak to thee."

Then Adam came out of the cave, thinking he was one of
God's angels that was come to give him some good counsel.

CHAPTER LYII.

Seventh apparition of Satan to Adam and Eve.

But when Adam came out and saw his hideous figure, lie
was afraid of him, and said unto him, " Who art thou 1'*

Then Satan answered and said unto him, " It is I, who hid
myself within the serpent, and who talked to Eve, and beguiled
her until she hearkened to my command. I am he who sent
her, through the wiles of my speech, to deceive thee, until thou
and she ate of the fruit of the tree, and ye came away from
under the command of God."

But when Adam heard these words from him, he said unto
him, " Canst thou make me a garden as God made for me ? Or
canst thou clothe me in the same bright nature in which" God
had clothed me ?

" Where is the divine nature thou didst promise to give me ?
Where is that fair speech of thine, thou didst hold with us at
first, when we were in the garden ? "

Then Satan said unto Adam, " Thinkest thou, that when I
have spoken to one about anything, I shall ever bring it to
him or fulfil my word? Not so. For I myself have never
even thought of obtaining what I asked.

*' Therefore did I fall, and did 1 make you fall by that for
which I myself fell; and [with you] also, whosoever accepts
my counsel, falls thereby.

" But now, Adam, by reason of thy fall thou art under my
rule,* and I am king over thee ; because thou hast hearkened
to me, and hast transgressed against thy God. Neither will
there be any deliverance from my hands until the day promised
thee by thy God."

Again he said, "Inasmuch as we do not know the day
agreed upon with thee by thy God, nor the hour in which thou

shalt be delivered, for that reason will we multiply war and
murder upon thee and thy seed after thee.

" This is our will and our good pleasure, that we may not
leave one of the sons of men to inherit our orders* in heaven.

" For as to our abode, O Adam, it is in burning fire ; and
we will not cease our evil doing, no, not one day nor one hour.
And I, Adam, shall sow fire upon thee when thou comest
into the cave to dwell there.''

When Adam heard these words he wept and mourned, and
said unto Eve, " Hear what he said ; that he will not fulfil
aught of what he told thee in the garden. Did he really [then]
become king over us ?

" But we will ask God, who created us, to deliver us out of
his hands."



CHAPTER LVIII.

Then Adam and Eve spread their hands unto God, praying
and entreating Him to drive Satan away from them ; that he
do them no violence, and do not force them to deny God.

Then God sent to them at once His angel, who drove away
Satan from them. This happened about sunset, on the fifty-
third dayt after they had come out of the garden.

Then Adam and Eve went into the cave, and stood up and
turned their faces to the earth, to pray to God.

But ere they prayed Adam said unto Eve, " Lo, thou hast
seen what temptations^ have befallen us in this land. Come,
let us arise, and ask God to forgive us the sins we have com-
mitted ; and we will not come out until the end of the day next
to the fortieth. And if we die herein. He will save us."

Then Adam and Eve arose, and joined together in entreating
God.

They abode thus praying in the cave j neither did they come
out of it, by night or by day, until their prayers went up out
of their mouths, like a flame of fire.



CHAPTER LIX.

Eighth apparition of Satan to Adam and Eve.

But Satan, the hater of all good, did not allow them to end
their prayers. For he called to his hosts, and they came, all
of them. He then said to them, " Since Adam and Eve, whom
we beguiled, have agreed together to pray to God night and
day, and to entreat Him to deliver them, and [since they] will
not come out of the cave until the end of the fortieth day.

" And since they will continue their prayers as they have
both agreed to do, that He will deliver them out of our hands,
and restore them to their [former] state, see what we shall do
unto them." And his hosts said unto him, " Power is thine, O
our Lord, to do what thou listest."

Then Satan, great in wickedness, took his hosts and came
into the cave, in the thirtieth night of the forty days and one ;
and he smote Adam and Eve, until he left them dead.

Then came the Word of God unto Adam and Eve, who
raised them from their suffering, and God said unto Adam,
" Be strong, and be not afraid of him who has just come to
thee."

But Adam wept and said, "Where wast Thou, O my God,
that they should smite me with such blows, and that this
suffering should come upon us j upon me and upon Eve, Thy
handmaid ? "

Then God said unto him, " Adam, see, he is lord and
master* of all thou hast, he who said, he would give thee

divinity. Where is his love for thee ? And where is the g^ft
he promised ?

''For once has it pleased him, Adam, to come to thee,
to comfort thee, and to strengthen thee, and to rejoice with
thee, and to send his hosts to guard thee ; because thou hast
hearkened to him, and hast yielded to his counsel; and hast
transgressed My commandment but has followed his behest ? "

Then Adam wept before the Lord, and said, " O Lord
because I transgressed a little. Thou hast sorely plagued me
in return for it, I ask Thee to deliver me out of his hands ; or
else have pity on me, and take my soul out of my body now in
this strange land."

Then God said unto Adam, "If only there had been this
sighing and praying before, ere thou didst transgress ! Then
wouldst thou have rest from the trouble in which thou art
now."

But God had patience with Adam, and let him and Eve
remain in the cave until they had fulfilled the forty days.

But as to Adam and Eve, their strength and flesh withered
from fasting and praying, from hunger and thirst; for they
had not tasted either food or drink since they left the garden ;
nor were the functions of their bodies yet settled ; and they
had no strength left to continue in prayer from hunger, until
the end of the next day to the fortieth. They were fallen
down in the cave ; yet what speech escaped from their mouths,
was only in praises.



CHAPTER LX.

Ninth apparition of Satan to Adam and Eve.

Then on the eighty-ninth day, Satan came to the cave, clad
in a garment of light,*° and girt about with a bright girdle.

0*



68 THE BOOK OF ADAM AND EVE. [book

In his hands was a staff of light, and he looked most awful :
but his face was pleasant and his speech was sweet.

He thus transformed himself in order to deceive Adam and
Eve, and to make them come out of the cave, ere they had
fulfilled the forty days.

For he said within himself, " Now that when they had
fulfilled the forty days' fasting and praying, God would restore
them to their [former] estate ; but if He did not do so. He
would still be favourable to them ; and even if He had not
mercy on them, would He yet give them something from the
garden to comfort them ; as already twice before.''

Then Satan drew near the cave in this fair appearance, and
said : —

" Adam, rise ye, stand up, thou and Eve, and come along
with me, to a good land ; and fear not. I am flesh and bones
like you ; and at first I was a creature that God created.

" And it was so, that when He had created me, He placed in
a garden in the north,* on the border of the world.

" And He said to me, ' Abide here.' And I abode there
according to His Word, neither did I transgress His command-
ment.

" Then He made a slumber to come over me, and He
brought thee, Adam, out of my side, but did not make thee
abide by me.

" But God took thee in His divine hand, and placed thee in
a garden to the eastward.

" Then I grieved because of thee, for that while God had
taken thee out of my side. He had not let thee abide with me.

" But God said unto me : ' Grieve not because of Adam, whom
I brought out of thy side ; no harm will come to him.

" ' For now I have brought out of his side a help-meet for
him ; and I have given him joy by so doing.' "

Then Satan said again, " I did not know how it is ye are in

* Lit. of the north; t.«., the northern paradise or garden.

this cave, nor anything about this trial that has come upon you
— until God said to me, * Behold, Adam has transgressed, he
whom I had taken out of thy side, and Eve also, whom I took
out of his side ; and I have driven them out of the garden ;
I have made them dwell in a land of sorrow and misery,
because they transgressed against Me, and have hearkened
to Satan. And lo, they are in suffering unto this day, the
eightieth/

** Then God said unto me, ' Arise, go to them, and make them
come to thy place, and suffer not that Satan come near them,
and afflict them. For they are now in great misery ; and lie
helpless* from hunger.'

" He further said to me, * When thou hast taken them to
thyself, give them to eat of the fruit of the Tree of Life, and
give them to drink of the water of peace ; and clothe them in
a garment of light, and restore fchem to their former state of
grace, and leave them not in misery, for they came from thee.
But grieve not over them, nor repentf of that which has come
upon them.'

" But when I heard this, I was sorry ; and my heart could
not patiently bear it for thy sake, my child.

" But, O Adam, when I heard the name of Satan, I was
afraid, and I said within myself,J I will not come out, lest he
ensnare me, as he did my children, Adam and Eve.

** And I said, ' God, when I go to my children, Satan will
meet me in the way, and war against me, as he did against
them.'

" Then God said unto me, ' Fear not; when thou findest him,
smite him with the staff that is in thine hand, and be not
afraid of him, for thou art [of] old [standing] , and he shall not
prevail against thee.'

" Then I said, ' my Lord, I am old, and cannot go. Send

" But God said unto me, ' Angels, verily, are not like them ;
and they will not consent to come with them. But I have

" God said further to me, * If thou hast not strength to walk,
I will send a cloud to carry thee and alight thee at the entrance
of their cave; then the cloud will return and leave thee [there].

" ' And if they will come with thee, I will send a cloud to

" Then He commanded a cloud, and it bare me up and
brought me to you ; and then went back.

"And now, my children, Adam and Eve, look at my hoar
hairs and at my feeble estate, and at my coming from that
distant place. Come, come with me, to a place of rest."

Then he began to weep and to sob before Adam and Eve,
and his tears poured upon the earth like water.

And when Adam and Eve raised their eyes and saw his
beard, and heard his sweet talk,* their hearts softened towai'ds
him ; they hearkened unto him, for they believed he was true.

And it seemed to them that they really were his offspring,
when they saw that his face was like their own; and they
trusted him.



CHAPTER LXI.

Then he took Adam and Eve by the hand, and began to
bring them out of the cave.

But when they were come a little way out of it, God knew
that Satan had overcome them, and had brought them out ere
the forty days were ended, to take them to some distant place,
and to destroy them.

Then the Word of the Lord God again came and cursed
Satan, and drove him away from them.

* Or, speech.



I.] GOB SPEAKS TO ADAM AND EVE. 71

And God began to speak unto Adam and Eve, saying to
them, "What made you come out of the cave, unto this
place ? "

Then Adam said unto God, " Didst thou create a man before
us ? For when we were in the cave there suddenly came unto
us a good old man who said to us, ' I am a messenger from God
unto you, to bring you back to some place of rest/

" And we did believe, God, that he was a messenger from
Thee; and we came out with him; and knew not whither we
should go with him/'

Then God said unto Adam, " See, that is the father of evil
arts,* who brought thee and Eve out of the Garden of Delights.
And now, indeed, when he saw that thou and Eve both joined
together in fasting and praying, and that you came not out of
the cave before the end of the forty days, he wished to make
your purpose vain, to breakf your mutual bond ; to cut off all
hope from you, and to drive you to some place where he might
destroy you.

" Because he was unable to do aught to you, unless he
showed himself in the likeness of you.

" Therefore did he come to you with a face like your own,
and began to give you tokens as if they were all true.J

" But I in mercy and with the favour I had unto you, did not
allow him to destroy you ; but I drove him away from you.

''Now, therefore, Adam, take Eve, and return to your
cave, and remain in it until the morrow of the fortieth day.§
And when ye come out, go towards the eastern gate of the

Then Adam and Eve worshipped God, and praised and
blessed Him for the deliverance that had come to them from
Him. And they returned towards the cave. This happened

Then Adam and Eve stood up [and] witli great zeal,* prayed
to God, to be brought out of their wantf of strength ; for their
strength had departed from them, through hunger and thirst
and prayer. But they watched the whole of that night
praying, until morning.

Then Adam said unto Eve, " Arise, let us go towards the
eastern gate of the garden as God told us."

And they said their prayers as they were wont to do every
day ; and they went out of the cave, to go near to the eastern
gate of the garden.

Then Adam and Eve stood up and prayed, and besought God
to strengthen them, and to send them something to satisfy
their hunger.*^

But when they had ended their prayers, they remained
[where they were] by reason of their failing strength.

Then came the Word of God again, and said unto them,
"0 Adam, arise, go and bring hither two figs.^*

Then Adam and Eve arose, and went until they drew near
to the cave.



CHAPTER LXII.
Tenth apparition of Satan to Adam and Eve, about the figs.

But Satan the wicked, was envious, because of the consola-
tion God had given them. J

So he prevented them, and went into the cave and took the
two figs, and buried them outside the cave, so that Adam and
Eve should not find them. He also had in his thoughts to
destroy them.

But by God's mercy, as soon as those two figs were in the
earth, God defeated Satan's counsel regarding them; and

• Lit. labour, fervonr, or toil. t I^ck, or poverty.

X Or, because God had comforted them.



I.] TENTH APPARITION OF SATAN. 73

made them into two fruit-trees, that overshadowed the cave.
For Satan had buried them on the eastern side of it.

Then when the two trees were grown, and were covered with
fruit, Satan grieved and mourned, and said, " Better were it to
have left those figs as they were ; for now, behold, they have
become two fruit-trees, whereof Adam will eat all the days
of his life. Whereas I had in mind, when I buried them, to
destroy them entirely, and to hide them for aye.

" But God has overturned my counsel ; and would not that
this sacred fruit should perish ; and He has made plain my
intention, and has defeated the counsel I had formed against
His servants.^'

Then Satan went away ashamed, of not having^wrought out
his design.



CHAPTER LXIII.

But Adam and Eve, as they drew near to the cave, saw two
fig-trees, covered with fruit, and overshadowing the cave.

Then Adam said to Eve, " It seems to me we have gone
astray. When did these two trees grow here ? It seems to me
that the enemy wishes to lead us astray. Sayest thou that
there is in the earth another cave than this ?

" Yet, Eve, let us go into the cave, and find in it the two
figs ; for this is our cave, in which we were. But if we should
not find the two figs in it, then it cannot be our cave.'^

They went then into the cave, and looked into the four
corners of it, but found not the two figs.

And Adam wept, and said to Eve, " Are we come to a wrong
cave, then, Eve ? It seems to me these two fig-trees are the
two figs that were in the cave." And Eve said, " I, for my
part, do not know."

Then Adam stood up and prayed and said, " O God, Thou



74 THE BOOK OF ADAM AND EVE. [book

didst command us to come back to the cave, to take the two
figs, and then to return to Thee.

''But now, we have not found them. God, hast Thou
taken them, and sown these two trees, or have we gone astray
in the earth ; or has the enemy deceived us ? If it be real,
then, God, reveal to us the secret of these two trees and
of the two figs."

Then came the Word of God to Adam, and said unto him,
" Adam, when I sent thee to fetch the figs, Satan went
before thee to the cave, took the figs, and buried them outside,
eastward of the cave, thinking to destroy them; and not sowing
them with good intent.

" Not for Lis mere sake, then, have these trees grown up at
once; but I had mercy on thee and I commanded them to
grow. And they grew to be two large trees, that you be over-
shadowed by their branches, and find rest ; and that I make
you see My power and My marvellous works.

" And, also, to show you Satan's meanness, and his evil
works, for ever since ye came out of the garden, he has not
ceased, no, not one day, from doing you some harm. But I
have not given him power over you.*'

And God said, " Henceforth, Adam, rejoice on account of
the trees, thou and Eve ; and rest under them when ye feel
weary. But eat not of their fruit, nor come near them.*'

Then Adam wept, and said, '' O God, wilt Thou again kill
us, or wilt Thou drive us away from before Thy face, and cut
our life from off the face of the earth ?

" God, I beseech Thee, if Thou knowest that there be in
these trees either death or some other evil, as at the first time,*
root them up from near our cave, and wither them ; and leave
us to die of the heat, of hunger and of thirst.

" For we know Thy marvellous works, God, that they are
great, and that by Thy power Thou canst bring one thing out

* In the garden.



1.] GOD GIVES THEM FIGS TO EAT. 75

of another, without one's wish.* For Thy power can make
rocks to become trees, and trees to become rocks/'



CHAPTER LXIV.

Then God looked upon Adam and upon his strength of mind,
upon his endurance of hunger and thirst, and of the heat.
And he changed the two fig-trees into two figs, as they were at
first, and then said to Adam and to Eve, " Each of you may take
one fig." And they took them, as the Lord commanded them.

And he said to them, " Go ye into the cave, and eat the figs,
and satisfy your hunger, lest ye die.'*

So, as God commanded them, they went into the cave, about
the time when the sun was setting. And Adam and Eve stood
up and prayed at the time of the setting sun.

Then they sat down to eat the figs ; but they knew not how
to eat them ; for they were not accustomed to eat earthly food.
They feared also lest, if they ate, their stomach should be
burdened and their flesh thickened, and their hearts take to
liking earthly food.

But while they were thus seated, God, out of pity for them,
sent them His angel, lest they should perish of hunger and
thirst.

And the angel said unto Adam and Eve, " God says to you
that ye have not strength to fast until death ; eat, therefore,
and strengthen your bodies ; for ye are now animal flesh, that
cannot subsist without food and drink.''

Then Adam and Eve took the figs and began to eat of them.
But God had put into them a mixture as of savoury bread and
blood.

Then the angel went from Adam and Eve, who ate of the
figs until they had satisfied their hunger. Then they put by
what remained ; but by the power of God, the figs became full

76 THE BOOK OF ADAM AND EVE. [book

as before, because God blessed them. After this Adam and
Eve arose, and prayed with a joyful heart and renewed
strength, and praised and rejoiced abundantly the whole of
that night. And this was the end of the eighty-third day.



CHAPTER LXV.

And when it was day, they rose and prayed, after their
custom, and then went out of the cave.

But as they felt great trouble from the food they had eaten,
and to which they were not used, they went about in the cave
saying to each other : —

" What has happened to us through eating, that this pain
should have come upon us ? Woe be to us, we shall die !
Better for us to have died than to have eaten; and to have
kept our bodies pure, than to have defiled them [with food] ."

Then Adam said to Eve, " This pain did not come to us in
the garden, neither did we eat such bad food there. Thinkest
thou, Eve, that God will plague us through the food that is
in us, or that our inwards will come out ; or that God means
to kill us with this pain before He has fulfilled His promise
to us ? "

Then Adam besought the Lord and said, " O Lord, let us
not perish through the food we have eaten. Lord, smite us
not ; but deal with us according to Thy great mercy, and
forsake us not until the day of the promise Thou hast made us."

Then God looked upon them, and at once fitted them for
eating food ; as unto this day ; so that they should not perish.

Then Adam and Eve came back into the cave sorrowful and
weeping because of the alteration in their nature. And they
both knew from that hour that they were altered [beings],
that their hope of returning to the garden was now cut oflf;
and that they could not enter it.



I.] GOD GIVES THEM WATER TO DRINK. 77

For that now their bodies had strange functions; and all
flesh that requires food and drink for its existence, cannot be
in the garden.

Then Adam said to Eve, " Behold, our hope is now cut off;
and so is our trust to enter the garden. We no longer belong
to the inhabitants of the garden; but henceforth we are earthy
and of the dust, and of the inhabitants of the earth. We shall
not return to the garden, until the day in which God has
promised to save us, and to bring us again into the garden, as
He promised us."

Then they prayed to God that He would have mercy on them;
after which, their mind was quieted, their hearts were broken,
and their longing was cooled down; and they were like
strangers on earth. That night Adam and Eve spent in the
cave, where they slept heavily by reason of the food they had
eaten.



CHAPTER LXVI.

When it was morning, the day after they had eaten food,
Adam and Eve prayed in the cave, and Adam said unto Eve,
" Lo, we asked for food of God, and He gave it. But now let
us also ask Him to give us a drink of water."

Then they arose, and went to the bank of the stream of
water, that was on the south border of the garden, in which
they had before thrown themselves. And they stood on the
bank, and prayed to God that He would command them to
drink of the water.

Then the Word of God came to Adam, and said unto him,
" O Adam, thy body is become brutish, and requires water to
drink. Take ye, and drink, thou and Eve ; give thanks and
praise."

Adam and Eve then drew near, and drank of it, until their
bodies felt refreshed. After having drunk, they praised G*"^'^



78 THE BOOK OF ADAM AND EVE. [book

and then returned to their cave, after their former custom.
This happened at the end of eighty-three days.

Then on the eighty-fourth day, they took two figs and hang
them in the cave, together with the leaves thereof, to be to
them a sign and a blessing from God. And they placed them
there until there should arise a posterity to them, who should
see the wonderful things God had done to them.

Then Adam and Eve again stood outside the cave, and
besought God to show them some food wherewith to nourish
their bodies.

Then the Word of God came and said unto him, " Adam,
go down to the westward of the cave, as far as a land of dark
soil,* and there thou shalt find food.'*

And Adam hearkened unto the Word of God, took Eve, and
went down to a land of dark soil, and found there wheat
growing, in the ear and ripe, and figs to eat; and Adam
rejoiced over it.

Then the Word of God came again to Adam, and said unto
him, " Take of this wheat and make thee bread of it, to
nourish thy body withal." And God gave Adam's heart
wisdom, to work out the corn until it became bread.

Adam accomplished all that, until he grew very faint and
weary. He then returned to the cave ; rejoicing at what he
had learned of what is done with wheat, until it is made into
bread for one's use.

Further details would lengthen too much the description of
them ; we therefore cut short [our narrative] .



CHA.PTBR LXVII.

First wonder that happened to Adam and Eve with Satan,
respecting the wheat.

But when Adam and Eve went down to the land of black

* Or, black mud.



I.] GOD GIVES TEEM WHEAT. 79

mud, and came near to the wheat God had showed them, and
saw it ripe* and ready for reaping, as they had no sickle to
reap it withal — they girt themselves, and began to pull up the
wheat, until it was all done. Then they made it into a heap ;
and, faint from heat and from thirst, they went under a shady
tree, where the breeze fanned them to sleep.

But Satan saw what Adam and Eve had done. And he
called his hosts, and said to them, " Since God has shown to
Adam and Eve all about this wheat, wherewith to strengthen
their bodies — and, lo, they are come and have made a heap of
it, and faint from [the toil] are now asleep — come, let us set
fire to [this heap of corn], and burn it, and let us take that
bottle of water that is by them, and empty it out, so that they
may find nothing to drink, and we kill them with hunger and
thirst.

" Then, when they wake up from their sleep, and seek to
return to the cave, we will come to them in the way, and will
lead them astray ; so that they die of hunger and thirst ; when
they may, perhaps, deny God, and He destroy them. So shall
we be rid of them."t

Then Satan and his hosts threw fire upon the wheat and
consumed it.

But from the heat of the flame Adam and Eve awoke from
their sleep, and saw the wheat burning, and the bucket of
water by them, poured out.

Then they wept and went back to the cave.

But as they were going up from below the mountain [where
they were], Satan and his hosts met them in the form of
angels, praising [God].

Then Satan said to Adam, " Adam, why art thou so
pained with hunger and thirst ? It seems to me that Satan
has burnt up the wheat.'' And Adam said to him, " Ay."

Again Satan said to Adam, " Come back with us ; we are

* Lit. dry. t ^it. have rest from them.



80 THE BOOK OF ADAM AND EVE. [book

angels of God. God sent us to thee, to show thee another
field of corn, better than that ; and beyond it is a fountain of
good water, and many trees, where thou shalt dwell near it,
and work the corn-field to better [purpose] than that which
Satan has consumed/'

Adam thought that he was true, and that they were angels
who talked with him ; and he went back with them.

Then Satan began to lead astray Adam and Eve eight days,
until they both fell down as if dead, from hunger, thirst, and
faintness. Then he fled with his hosts, and left them.



CHAPTER LXVIII.

Then God looked upon Adam and Eve, and upon what had
come upon them from Satan, and how he had made them
perish.

God, therefore, sent His Word, and raised up Adam and Eve
from their state of death.

Then, Adam, when he was raised, said, " God, Thou hast
burnt [and taken] from us the corn Thou hadst given us, and
Thou hast emptied out the bucket of water. And Thou hast
sent Thy angels, who have waylaid us from the corn-field.
Wilt Thou make us perish ? If this be from Thee, O God,
then take away our souls ; but punish us not.''

Then God said to Adam, " I did not burn down the wheat,
and I did not pour the water out of the bucket, and I did
not send My angels to lead thee astray.

" But it is Satan, thy master [who did it] ; he to whom thou
hast subjected thyself; My commandment being [meanwhile]
set aside. He it is, who burnt down the corn, and poured out
the water, and who has led thee astray ; and all the promises
he has made you, verily are but feint, and deceit, and a lie.

" But now, Adam, thou shalt acknowledge My good deeds
done to thee."



I.] ADAM'S OFFERING OF WHEAT 81

And God told His angels to take Adam and Eve, and to
bear them up to the field of wheat,* which they found as before,
with the bucket full of water. There they saw a tree, and
found on it solid manna ; and wondered at God's power. And
the angels commanded them to eat of the manna when they
were hungry.

And God adjured Satan with a curse, not to come again, and
destroy the field of corn.

Then Adam and Eve took of the corn, and made of it an
ofiering,f and took it and offered it up on the mountain, the
place where they had offered up their first offering of blood.

And they offered this oblation again on the altar they had
built at first. And they stood up and prayed, and besought
the Lord saying, " Thus, God, when we were in the garden,
did our praises go up to Thee, like this offering; and our
innocencej went up to the like incense. But now, God,
accept this offering from us, and tarn us not back, reft§ of Thy
mercy. ||

Then God said to Adam and Eve, " Since ye have made this
oblation and have offered it to Me, I shall make it My flesh,^
when I come down upon earth to save you ; and I shall cause
it to be offered continually upon an altar, for forgiveness and
for mercy, unto those who partake of it duly."

And God sent a bright fire upon the offering of Adam and
Eve, and filled it with brightness, grace, and light ; and the
Holy Ghost came down upon that oblation.

Then God commanded an angel to take fire-tongs, like a
spoon,** and with it to take an offering and bring it to Adam

and Eve. And the angel did so, as God had commanded him,
and offered it to them.

And the souls of Adam and Eve were brightened, and their
hearts were filled with joy and gladness and with the praises of
God.

And God said to Adam, " This shall be unto you a custom,
to do so, when affliction and sorrow come upon you. But your
deliverance and your entrance into the garden, shall not be
until the days are fulfilled, as [agreed] between you and Me ;
were it not so, I would, of My mercy and pity for you, bring
you back to My garden and to My favour for the sake of the
offering you have just made to My name.''

Adam rejoiced at these words which he heard from God ;
and he and Eve worshipped before the altar, to which they
bowed, and then went back to the Cave of Treasures.

And this took place at the end of the twelfth day after
the eightieth day, from the time Adam and Eve came out of
the garden.

And they stood up the whole night praying until morning -,
and then went out of the cave.

Then Adam said to Eve, with joy of heart, because of the
offering they had made to God, and that had been accepted of
Him, " Let us do this three times every week, on the fourth
day [Wednesday], on the preparation day [Friday], and on
the Sabbath [Sunday] , all the days of our life.''

And as they agreed to these words between themselves, God
was pleased with their thoughts, and with the resolution they
had each taken with the other.

After this, came the Word of God to Adam, and said,
" Adam, thou hast determined beforehand the days in which
sufferings shall come upon Me, when I am made fiesh; for
they are th« fourth [Wednesday], and the preparation day
[Friday] .

" But as to the first day, I created in it all things, and I
raised the heavens. And, again, through My rising again on



I.] TWELFTH APPARITION OF SATAN. 83

this day, will I create joy, and raise them on high, who believe
in Me ; Adam, offer this oblation, all the days of thy life/*

Then God withdrew His Word from Adam.

But Adam continued to offer this oblation thus, every week
three times, until the end of seven weeks. And on the first
day, which is the fii'tieth, Adam made an offering as he was
wont, and he and Eve took it and came to the altar before God,
as He had taught them.



CHAPTER LXIX.

Twelfth apparition of Satan to Adam and Eve, ivhile Adam
was praying over the offering upon the altar ; when Sa,tan smote
him.

Then Satan, the hater of all good, envious of Adam and of
his offering through which he found favour with God, hastened
and took a sharp stone from among sharp iron-stones ; appeared
in the form of a man, and went and stood by Adam and Eve.

Adam was then offering on the altar, and had begun to
pray, with his hands spread unto God.

Then Satan hastened with the sharp iron-stone he had with
him, and with it pierced Adam on the right side, whence
flowed blood and water, then Adam fell upon the altar like a
corpse. And Satan fled.

Then Eve came, and took Adam and placed him below the
altar. And there she stayed, weeping over him ; while a
stream of blood flowed from Adam's side upon his offering.

But God looked upon the death of Adam. He then sent His
Word, and raised him up and said unto him, '* Fulfil thy
offering, for indeed, Adam, it is worth much, and there is no
shortcoming* in it.'*

God said further unto Adam, " Thus will it also happen t»

* Also : lack, or imperfection, defect, or deficiency.

*



84 THE BOOK OF ADAM AND EVE. [book

Me, on the earth, when I shall be pierced and blood shall flow,
blood and water from My side, and run over My body, which
is the true offering ; and which shall be offered on the altar as
a perfect offering/'

Then God commanded Adam to finish his offering, and when
he had ended it he worshipped before God, and praised Him
for the signs He had showed him.

And God healed Adam in one day, which is the end of the
seven weeks ; and that is the fiftieth day.

Then Adam and Eve returned from the mountain, and went
into the Cave of Treasures, as they were used to do. This
completed for Adam and Eve, one hundred and forty days since
their coming out of the garden.

Then they both stood up that night and prayed to God.
And when it was morning, they went out, and went down
westward of the cave, to the place where their com was, and
there rested under the shadow of a tree, as they were wont.

But [when there] a multitude of beasts came all round
them. It was Satan's doing, in his wickedness ; in order to
wage war against Adam through marriage.



CHAPTER LXX.

Thirteenth apparition of Satan to Adam and Eve, to maJee
war against him, through his marriage with Eve.

After this Satan, the hater of all good, took the form of an
angel, and with him two others, so that they looked like the
three angels who had brought to Adam, gold, incense, and
myrrh.

They passed before Adam and Eve while they were under
the tree, and greeted Adam and Eve with fair words that were
full of guile.

But when Adam and Eve saw their comely mien, and [heard]



1.] THIRTEENTH APPARITION OF SATAN. 85

their sweet speech, Adam rose, welcomed them, and brought
them to Eve, and they remained all together; Adam's heart
the while, being glad because he thought concerning them,
that they were the same angels, who had brought him gold,
incense, and myrrh.

Because, when they came to Adam the first time, there
came upon him from them, peace and joy, through their
bringing him good tokens ; so Adam thought that they were
come a second time to give him other tokens for him to rejoice
withal. For he did not know it was Satan ; therefore did he
receive them with joy and companied with them.

Then Satan, the tallest of them, said, " Rejoice, Adam,
and be glad. Lo, God has sent us to thee to tell thee some-
thing."

And Adam said, '^ What is it ? " Then Satan answered,
" It is a light thing, yet it is a word of God, wilt thou hear it
from us and do it ? But if thou hearest not, we will return
to God, and tell Him that thou wouldest not receive His word."

And Satan said again to Adam, " Fear not, neither let a
trembling come upon thee ; dost not thou know us V

But Adam said, " I know you not."

Then Satan said to him, " I am the angel who brought thee
gold, and took it to the cave ; this other one is he who brought
thee incense ; and that third one, is he who brought thee myrrh
[when thou wast] on the top of the mountain, and who carried
thee to the cave.

But as to [the other angels] our fellows, who bare you to
the cave, God has not sent them with us this time ; for He
said to us, " You suffice."

So when Adam heard these words he believed them, and
said to these angels, " Speak the word of God, that I may
receive it."

And Satan said unto him, " Swear, and promise me that
thou wilt receive it."

Then Adam said, " I know not how to swear and promise."



86 THE BOOK OF ADAM AND EVE. [book

And Satan said to him, " Hold out thy hand, and put it
inside my hand."

Then Adam held out his hand, and put it into Satan's hand ;
when Satan said unto him, " Say, now — so true* as God is
living, rational, and speaking", who raised the heavens in the
space, and established the earth upon the waters, and has
created me out of the four elements, and out of the dust of the
earth — I will not breakf my promise, nor renounce my word."
And Adam swore thus.

Then Satan said to him, " Lo, it is now some time since
thou camest out of the garden, and thou knowest neither
wickedness nor evil. But now God says to thee, to take Eve
who came out of thy side, and to wed her, that she bear thee
children, to comfort thee, and to drive from thee trouble and
sorrow ; now this thing is not difficult, neither is there any
scandal in it to thee."



CHAPTER LXXI.

But when Adam heard these words from Satan, he sorrowed
much, because of his oath and of his promise, and said, " Shall
I commit adulteiy with my [flesh and my] bones, and shall I
sin against myself, for God to destroy me, and to blot me out
from ofl" the face of the earth ?

" Since, when at first, I ate of the tree, He drove me out of
the garden into this strange land, and deprived me of [my]
bright nature, and brought death upon me. If, then, I should
do this, He will cut off my life from the earth, and He will cast
me into hell, and will plague me there a long time.

" But God never spoke the words thou hast told me ; and
ye are not God's angels, nor yet sent from Him. But ye are
devils, come to me under the false appearance of angels. Away
from me ; ye cursed of God !"

* Lit. as indeed. •f Lit. foul.



I.] ADAM'S OATH TO SATAN. 87

Then those devils fled from before Adam. And he and Eve
arose, and returned to the Cave of Treasures, and went into it.

Then Adam said to Eve, " If thou sawest what I did, tell
it not ; for I sinned against God in swearing by His great
name, and I have placed my hand another time into that of
Satan.*' Eve, then, held her peace, as Adam told her.

Then Adam arose, and spread his hands unto God, beseeching
and entreating Hitn with tears, to forgive him what he had
done. And Adatn remained thus standing and praying forty
days and forty nights. He neither ate nor drank until he
dropped down upon the earth from hunger and thirst.

Then God sent His Word unto Adam, who raised him up
from where he lay, and said unto him, " Adam, why hast
thou sworn by My name, and why hast thou made agreement
with Satan another time ? "

But Adam wept, and said, " God, forgive me, for I did
this unwittingly ; believing they were God's angels."

And God forgave Adam, saying to him, " Beware of Satan."

And He withdrew His Word from Adam.

Then Adam's heart was comforted ; and he took Eve, and
they went out of the cave, to make some food for their bodies.

But from that day Adam struggled in his mind about his
wedding Eve ; afraid as he was to do it, lest God should be
wroth with him.

Then Adam and Eve went to the river of water, and sat on
the bank, as people do when they enjoy themselves.

But Satan was jealous of them ; and would destroy them.

CHAPTER LXXII.

Fourteenth apparition of Satan to Adam and Eve ; as coming
up out of the river, in the similitude of young maidens.

Then Satan, and ten from his hosts, transformed themselves
into maidens, unlike any others in the whole world for grace.



88 THE BOOK OF ADAM AND EVE. [book

They came up out of the river in presence of Adam and Eve,
and they said among themselves, " Come, we will look at the
faces of Adam and of Eve, who are of the men upon earth.
How beautiful they are, and how different is their look from
our own faces." Then they came to Adam and Eve, and
greeted them ; and stood wondering at them.

Adam and Eve looked at them also, and wondered at their
beauty, and said, " Is there, then, under us, another world,
with such beautiful creatures as these in it ? "

And those maidens said to Adam and Eve, " Yes, indeed, we
are an abundant creation."

Then Adam said to them, " But how do you multiply ? "

And they answered him, " We have husbands who wedded
us, and we bear them children, who grow up, and who in their
turn wed and are wedded, and also bear children ; and thus we
increase. And if so be, O Adam, thou wilt not believe us, we
will show thee our husbands and our children."

Then they shouted over the river as if to call their husbands
and their children, who came up from the river, men and
children ; and every one came to his wife, his children being
with him.

But when Adam and Eve saw them, they stood dumb, and
wondered at them.

Then they said to Adam and Eve, " You see our husbands
and our children, wed Eve as we wed our wives, and you shall
have children the same as we." This was a device of Satan to
deceive Adam.

Satan also thought within himself, " God at first commanded
Adam concerning the fruit of the tree, saying to him, ' Eat
not of it ; else of death thou shalt die.' But A dam ate of it,
and yet God did not kill him; He only decreed upon him
death, and plagues and trials, until the day he shall come out
of his body.

" Now, then, if I deceive him to do this thing, and to wed
Eve without God's commandment, God will kill him then."



I.] FOURTEENTH APPARITION OF SATAN. 89

Therefore did Satan work this apparition before Adam and
Eve; because he sought to kill him, and to make him disappear
from off the face of the earth.

Meanwhile the fire of sin came upon Adam, and he thought
of committing sin. But he restrained himself, fearing lest if
he followed this advice [of Satan] God would put him to
death.

Then Adam and Eve arose, and prayed to God, while Satan
and his hosts went down into the river, in presence of Adam
and Eve ; to let them see that they were going back to their
own regions.

Then Adam and Eve went back to the Cave of Treasures,
as they were wont ; about evening time.

And they both arose and prayed to God that night. Adam
remained standing in prayer, yet not knowing how to pray, by
reason of the thoughts of his heart regarding his wedding Eve;
and he continued so until morning.

And when light arose, Adam said unto Eve, " Arise let us
go below the mountain, where they brought us gold, and let
us ask the Lord concerning this matter."

Then Eve said, " What is that matter, Adam V

And he answered her, " That I may request the Lord to
inform me about wedding thee ; for I will not do it without
His order, lest He make us perish, thee and me. For those
devils have set my heart on fire, with thoughts of what they
showed us, in their sinful apparitions.''

Then Eve said to Adam, "Why need we go below the
mountain ? Let us rather stand up and pray in our cave to
God, to let us know whether this counsel is good or not."

Then Adam rose up in prayer and said, " God, Thou
knowest that we transgressed against Thee, and from the
moment we transgressed, we were bereft of our bright nature ;
and our body became brutish, requiring food and drink ; and
with animal desires.

" Command us, God, not to give way to them without Thy



90 TEE BOOK OF ADAM AND EVE. [book

order, lest Thou bring us to nothing. For if Thou give us not
the order, we shall be overpowered, and follow that advice [of
Satan] ; and Thou wilt again make us perish.

" If not, then take our souls from us ; let us be rid of this
animal lust. And if Thou give us no order respecting this
thing, then sever Eve from me, and me from her ; and place
us each far away from the other.

" Yet again, God, when Thou hast put us asunder from
each other, the devils will deceive us with their apparitions,
and destroy our hearts, and deJBle our thoughts towards each
other. Yet if it is not each of us towards the other, it will, at
all events, be through their appearance when they show them-
selves to us." Here Adam ended his prayer.



CHAPTER LXXni.

Tlien God looked upon the words of Adam that they were
true, and that he could long await [His order], respecting the
counsel of Satan.

And God approved Adam in what he had thought concerning
this, and in the prayer he had offered in His presence ; and
the Word of God came unto Adam and said to him, " Adam,
if only thou hadst had this caution at first, ere thou camest
out of the garden into this land V

After that, God sent His angel who had brought gold, and
the angel who had brought incense, and the angel who had
brought myrrh to Adam, that they should infer oi him
respecting his wedding Eve.

Then those angels said to Adam, " Take the gold and give
it to Eve as a wedding gift, and betroth her ; then give her
some incense and myrrh as a present ; and be ye, thou and she,
one flesh.**

Adam hearkened to the angels, and took the gold and put



I.] BIRTH OF OAIN AND OF LULUWA. 91

it into Eve's bosom in her garment ; and bethrothed her with
his hand.

Then the angels commanded Adam and Eve, to arise and
pray forty days and forty nights ; and after that, that Adam
should come in to his wife ; for then this would be an act pure
and undefiled ; and he should have children who would
multiply, and replenish the face of the earth.

Then both Adam and Eve received the words of the angels ;
and the angels departed from them.

Then Adam and Eve began to fast and to pray, until the end
of the forty days ; and then they came together, as the angels
had told them. And from the time Adam left the garden until
he wedded Eve, were two hundred and twenty-thi*ee days, that
is seven months and thirteen days.

Thus was Satan's war with Adam defeated.



CHAPTER LXXIV.

And they dwelt on the earth working, in order to continue
in the well-being of their bodies ; and were so until the nine
months of Eve's child-bearing were ended, and the time drew
near when she must be delivered.

Then she said unto Adam, "ITiis cave is a pure spot by
reason of the signs [wrought in] it since [we left] the garden ;
and we shall again pray in it. It is not meet, then, that
I should bring forth in it ; let us rather repair to that of the
sheltering rock, which Satan hurled at us, when he wished to
kill us with it ; but that was held up and spread as an awning
over us by the command of God ; and formed a cave.''

Then Adam removed Eve to that cave ; and when the time
came that she should bring forth, she travailed much. So was
Adam sorry, and his heart suffered for her sake ; for she was
nigh unto death ; that the word of God to her should be



92 TEE BOOK OF ADAM AND EVE. [book

fulfilled : " In suffering slialt thou bear a child, and in sorrow
shalt thou bring forth thy child."

But when Adam saw the strait in which Eve was, he arose
and prayed to God, and said, " Lord, look upon me with the
eye of Thy mercy, and bring her out of her distress."

And Grod looked at His maid-servant Eve, and delivered her,
and she brought forth her first-bom son, and with him a
daughter. Then Adam rejoiced at Eve's deliverance, and also
over the children she had borne him. And Adam ministered
unto Eve in the cave, until the end of eight days ; when they
named the son Cain,* and the daughter Luluwa.f*^

The meaning of Cain is ''hater," because he hated his
sister in their mother's womb ; ere they came out of it.
Therefore did Adam name him Cain.

But Luluwa means " beautiful," because she was more
beautiful than her mother.

Then Adam and Eve waited until Cain and his sister were
forty days old, when Adam said unto Eve, " We will make an
ofiering and offer it up in behalf of the children."

And Eve said, " We will make one offering for the first-bom
son ; and afterwards we shall make one for the daughter."



CHAPTER LXXV.

Then Adam prepared an ofiering, and he and Eve offered
it up for their children, and brought it to the altar they had
built at first.

And Adam offered up the offering, and besought God to
accept his offering.

Then God accepted Adam's offering, and sent a light from
heaven that shone upon the offering. And Adam and the son
drew near to the offering, but Eve and the daughter did not
approach unto it.

* Eth. Cail. f " Lulawa " is the Arabic for " a pearl."



I.] ADAM'S OFFERINa FOR HIS CHILDREN. 93

Then Adam came down from upon the altar, and they were
joyful; and Adam and Eve waited until the daughter was
eighty days old ; then Adam prepared an offering and took it
to Eve and to the children ; and they went to the altar, where
Adam offered it up, as he was wont, asking the Lord to accept
his offering.

And the Lord accepted the offering of Adam and Eve. Then
Adam, Eve, and the children, drew near together, and came
down from the mountain, rejoicing.

But they returned not to the cave in which they were born ;
but came to the Cave of Treasures, in order that the children
should go round it, and be blessed with the tokens [brought]
from the garden.

But after they had been blessed with these tokens, they
went back to the cave in which they were born.

However, before Eve had offered up the offering, Adam had
taken her, and had gone with her to the river of water, in
which they threw themselves at first ; and there they washed
themselves. Adam washed his body and Eve piers also]
clean, after the suffering and distress that had come upon
them.

But Adam and Eve, after washing themselves in the river of
water, returned every night to the Cave of Treasures, where
they prayed and were blessed ; and then went back to their
cave, where the children were born.

So did Adam and Eve until the children had done sucking.
Then, when they were weaned, Adam made an offering for the
souls of his children ; other than the three times he made an
offering for them, every week.

When the days of nursing the children were ended. Eve
again conceived, and when her days were accomplished she
brought forth another son and daughter ; and they named the
son Abel, and the daughter Aklemia.

Then at the end of forty days, Adam made an offering for
the son, and at the end of eighty days he made another offering



94 TEE BOOK OF ADAM AND EVE. [book

for the daughter, and did by them, as he had done before by
Cain and his sister Luluwa.

He brought them to the Cave of Treasures, where they
received a blessing, and then returned to the cave where they
were born. After the birth of these, Eve ceased from child-
bearing.



CHAPTER LXXVI.

And the children began to wax stronger, and to grow in
stature; but Cain was hard-hearted, and ruled over his younger
brother.

And oftentimes when his father made an offering, he would
remain [behind] and not go with them, to offer up.

But, as to Abel, he had a meek heart, and was obedient to
his father and mother, whom he often moved to make an
offering, because he loved it ; and prayed and fasted much.

Then came this sign to Abel. As he was coming into the
Cave of Treasures, and saw the golden rods, the incense and
the myrrh, he inquired of his parents Adam and Eve con-
cerning them, and said unto them, " How did you come by
these V

Then Adam told him all that had befallen them. And Abel
felt deeply about what his father told him.

Furthermore his father Adam told him of the works of God,
and of the garden ; and after that, he remained behind his
father the whole of that night in the Cave of Treasures.

And that night, while he was praying, Satan appeared unto
him under the figure of a man, who said to him, " Thou hast
oftentimes moved thy father to make an offering, to fast and to
pray, therefore I will kill thee, and make thee perish from
this world.^'

But as for Abel, he prayed to God, and drove away [Satan]
from him ; and believed not the words of the devil. Then when



I.] SATAN APPEARS TO CAIN. 95

it was day, an angel of God appeared uuto him, wlio said to
him, " Shorten neither fasting, prayer, nor offering up an
oblation unto thy God. For, lo, the Lord has accepted thy
prayer. Be not afraid of the figure which appeared unto thee
in the night, and who cursed thee unto death.'' And the
angel departed from him.

Then when it was day, Abel came to Adam and Eve, and
told them of the vision he had seen. But when they heard it,
they grieved much over it, yet said nothing to him [about it] ;
they only comforted him.

But as to hard-hearted Cain, Satan came to him by night,
showed himself and said unto him, " Since Adam and Eve love
thy brother Abel much more than they love thee, and wish to
join him in marriage to thy beautiful sister, because they love
him ; but wish to join thee in marriage to his ill-favoured

sister, because they hate thee ;

" Now, therefore, I counsel thee, when they do that, to kill

thy brother; then thy sister will be left for thee; and his

sister will be cast away."

And Satan departed from him. But the wicked One

remained [behind] in the heart of Cain, who sought many

a time, to kill his brother.



CHAPTER LXXVII.

But when Adam saw that the elder brother hated the
younger, he endeavoured -to soften their hearts, and said unto
Cain, " Take, my son, of the fruits of thy sowing, and make
an offering unto God, that He may forgive thee thy wickedness
and thy sin."

He said also to Abel, " Take thou of thy sowing* and make
an offering and bring it to God, that He may forgive thy
wickedness and thy sin."

♦ Different from Gen. iv, 4.



96 THE BOOK OF ADAM AND EVE. [book

Then Abel hearkened unto his father's voice, and took of his
sowing, and made a good offering, and said to his father,
Adam, " Come with me, to show me how to offer it up."

And they went, Adam and Eve with him, and showed him
how to offer up his gift upon the altar. Then after that, they
stood up and prayed that God would accept Abel's offering.

Then God looked upon Abel and accepted his offering. And
God was more pleased with Abel than with his offering,
because of his good heart and pure body. There was no trace
of guile in him.

Then they came down from the altar, and went to the cave
in which they dwelt. But Abel, by reason of his joy at having
made his offering, repeated it three times a week, after the
example of his father Adam.

But as to Cain, he took no pleasure in offering ; but after
much anger on his father's part, he offered up his gift once ;
and when he did offer up, his eye was on the offering he
made,*^ and he took. the smallest of his sheep for an offering,
and his eye was again on it.

Therefore God did not accept his offering, because his heart
was full of murderous* thoughts.

And they all thus lived together in the cave in which Eve
had brought forth, until Cain was fifteen years old, and Abel
twelve years old.f



CHAPTER LXXVIII.

Then Adam said to Eve, " Behold the children are grown
up ; we must think of finding wives for them."
Then Eve answered, " How can we do it ?"

* Lit. destraction.

t MicLr. Tankhuma (fol. 5), however, says that Cain and Abel were then about
forty years old.



I.] SATAN'S COUNSEL TO CAIN. 97

Then Adam said to her, "We will join Abel's sister in
marriage to Cain,* and Cain's sister to Abel."

Then said Eve to Adam, " I do not like Cain because he is
hard-hearted; but let them bide until we offer up unto the
Lord in their behalf/'

And Adam said no more.

Meanwhile Satan came to Cain in the figure of a man of the
field, and said to him, '' Behold Adam and Eve have taken
counsel together about the marriage of you two j and they
have agreed to marry Abel's sister to thee, and thy sister to
him.

" But if it was not that I love thee, I would not have told
thee this thing. Yet if thou wilt take my advice, and hearken
to me, I will bring thee on thy wedding day beautiful robes,
gold and silver in plenty, and my relations will attendf thee."

Then Cain said with joy, " Where are thy relations ?"

And Satan answered, " My relations are in a garden in the
north, whither I once meant to bring thy father Adam ; but he
would not accept my offer.

" But thou, if thou wilt receive my [words] and if thou wilt
come unto me after thy wedding, thou shalt rest from the
misery in which thou art ; and thou shalt rest and be better
off than thy father Adam."

At these words of Satan Cain opened his ears, and leant
towards his speech.

And he did not remain in the field, but he went to Eve, his
mother, and beat her, and cursed her, and said to her, " Why
are ye about taking my sister to wed her to my brother ? Am
I dead?"

His mother, however, quieted J him, and sent him to the field
where he had been.

* Adam did so, in order to avoid marrying the brother to his sister of the same
birth, and thus to prevent, as far as possible, consanguinity. Masudi., ch, iii,

Then wlien Adam came, she told him of what Cain had
done.

But Adam grieved and held his peace, and said not a word.

Then on the morrow Adam said unto Cain his son, " Take of
thy sheep, young and good,*' and offer them up unto thy God ;
and I will speak to thy brother, to make unto his God an
offering of corn."

They both hearkened to their father Adam, and they took
their offerings, and offered them up on the mountain by the
altar.

But Cain behaved haughtily towards his brother, and thrust
him from the altar, and would not let him offer up his gift
upon the altar ; but he offered his own upon it, with a proud
heart, full of guile, and fraud.

But as for Abel, he set up stones [that were] near at hand,
and upon that, he offered up his gift with a heart humble and
free from guile.

Cain was then standing by the altar on which he had offered
up his gift ; and he cried unto God to accept his offering ; but
God did not accept it from him; neither did a divine fire come
down to consume his offering.

But he remained standing over against the altar, out of
humour and wroth, looking towards his brother Abel, to see if
God would accept his offering or not.

And Abel prayed unto God to accept his offering. Then a
divine fire came down and consumed his offering. And God
smelled the sweet savour of his offering ; because Abel loved
Him and rejoiced in Him.

And because God was well pleased with him He sent him an
angel of light in the figure of man who had partaken of his
offering, because He had smelled the sweet savour of his
offering, and they comforted Abel and strengthened his
heart.

But Cain was looking on all that took place at his brother's
offering, and was wroth on account of it.



I.] CAIN'S AND ABEUS OFFERINGS. 99

Then he opened his mouth and blasphemed God, because He
had not accepted his offering.

But God said unto Cain, " Wherefore is thy countenance
sad ?** Be righteous, that I may accept thy offering. Not
against Me hast thou murmured, but against thyself."

And God said this to Cain in rebuke, and. because He
abhorred him and his offering.

And Cain came down from the altar, his colour changed and
of a woeful countenance, and came to his father and mother and
told them all that had befallen him. And Adam grieved much
because God had not accepted Cain's offering.

But Abel came down rejoicing, and with a gladsome heart,
and tcld his father and mother how God had accepted his
offering. And they rejoiced at it and kissed his face.

And Abel said to his father, " Because Cain thrust me from
the altar, and would not allow me to offer my gift upon it,
I made an altar for myself and offered [my] gift upon it.'*

But when Adam heard this he was very sorry, because it
was the altar he had built at first, and upon which he had
offered his own gifts.

As to Cain, he was so sullen and so angry that he went into
the field, where Satan came to him and said to him, " Since thy
brother Abel has taken refuge with thy father Adam, because
thou didst thrust him from the altar, they have kissed his face,
and they rejoice over him, far more than over thee.'*

When Cain heard these words of Satan, he was filled with
rage ; and he let no one know. But he was laying wait to kill
his brother, until he brought him into the cave, and then said
to hitn : — *

" O brother, the country is so beautiful, and there are such
beautiful and pleasurable trees in it, and charming to look at !
But brother, thou hast never been one day in the field to take
thy pleasure therein.

* Lit. field.

100 THE BOOK OF ADAM AND EVE. [book

" To-day, O, my brother, I very much wish thou wouldest
come with me into the field,*^ to enjoy thyself and to bless our
fields and our flocks, for thou art righteous, and I love thee
much, O, my brother ! but thou hast estranged thyself from
me."

Then Abel consented to go with his brother Cain into the
field.

But before going out, Cain said to Abel, " Wait for me, until
I fetch a staff, because of wild beasts.''

Then Abel stood [waiting] in his innocence. But Cain, the
fro ward, fetched a staff and went out.

And they began, Cain and his brother Abel, to walk in the
way ; Cain talking to him, and comforting him, to make him
forget everything.



CHAPTER LXXIX.

Murder of Abel the Justy whom his brother, Gain the Injidel,

did kill.

And so they went on, until they came to a lonely place,
where there were no sheep ; then Abel said to Cain, " Behold,
my brother, we are weary of walking ; for we see none of the
trees, nor of the fruits, nor of the verdure, nor of the sheep,
nor any one of the things of which thou didst tell me. Where
are those sheep of thine thou didst tell me to bless ? "

Then Cain said to him, " Come on, and presently thou shalt
see many beautiful things, but go before me, until I come up
to thee.''

Then went Abel forward, but Cain remained behind him.

And Abel was walking in his innocence, without guile ; not
believing his brother would kill him.

Then Cain, when he came up to him, comforted him with



1.] CAIN KILLS HIS BROTHER ABEL. 101

[his] talk, walking a little behind him ; then he hastened, and
smote him with the staff, blow upon blow, until he was
stunned.

But when Abel fell down upon the ground, seeing that his
brother meant to kill him, he said to Cain, " O, my brother,
have pity on me. By the breasts we have sucked, smite me
not ! By the womb that bare us and that brought us into the
world, smite me not unto death with that staff ! If thou wilt
kill me, take one of these large stones, and kill me outright."

Then Cain, the hard-hearted, and cruel murderer, took a
large stone, and smote his brother with it upon the head,^ until
his brains oozed out, and he weltered in his blood, before him.
And Cain repented not of what he had done.

But the earth, when the blood of righteous Abel fell upon
it, trembled, as it drank his blood, and would have brought
Cain to naught [for it] .

And the blood of Abel cried mysteriously to God, to avenge
him of his murderer.

Then Cain began at once to dig the earth [wherein to lay]
his brother ;*^ for he was trembling from the fear that came upon
him, when he saw the earth tremble on his account.

He then cast his brother into the pit [he made] , and covered
him with dust.^ But the earth would not receive him ; but it
threw him up at once.

Again did Cain dig the earth and hid his brother in it ; but
again did the earth throw him up on itself; until three times
did the earth thus throw up on itself the body of Abel. The
muddy earth threw him up the first time, because he was not
the first creation ; and it threw him up the second time and
would not receive him, because he was righteous and good, and
was killed without a cause ; and the earth threw him up the
third time and would not receive him, that there might remain
before his brother a witness against him.

And so did the earth mock Cain, until the Word of God,
came to him concerninof his brother.



102 THE BOOK OF ADAM AND EVE. [book

Then was God angry, and much displeased* at Abel's death ;
and He thundered from heaven, and lightnings went before
Him, and the Word of the Lord God came from heaven to
Cain, and said unto him, " Where is Abel thy brother ?"

Then Cain answered with a proud heart and a gruff voice,
" How, O God ? am I my brother's keeper V*

Then God said unto Cain, " Cursed be the earth that has
drunk the blood of Abel thy brother; and thou, be thou
trembling and shaking ; and this will be a sign unto thee, that
whosoever finds thee, shall kill thee."

But Cain wept because God had said those words to him ;
and Cain said unto Him, " O God, whosoever finds me shall
kill me, and I shall be blotted out from the face of the
earth."

Then God said unto Cain, " Whosoever shall find thee shall
not kill thee ;" because before this, God had been saying to
Cain, "1 shall forego seven punishments on him who kills
Cain." For as to the word of God to Cain, "Where is thy
brother ?" God said it in mercy for him, to try aud make him
repent.

For if Cain had repented at that time, and had said, " God,
forgive me my sin, and the murder of my brother," God would
then have forgiven him his sin.

And as to God saying to Cain, " Cursed be the ground that
has drunk the blood of thy brother "*^ that also, was God's
mercy on Cain. For God did not curse him, but He cursed
the ground ; although it was not the ground that had killed
Abel, and had committed iniquity.

For it was meet that the curse should fall upon the murderer ;
yet in mercy did God so manage His thoughts as that no one
should know it, and turn away from Cain.

And He said to him, '* Where is thy brother ?" To which
he answered and said, " I know not." Then the Creator said
to him, " Be trembling and quaking."

* Lit. fighed over, was grieved.



1.] CURSE AND PUNISHMENT OF CAIN. 103

Then Cain trembled and became terrified ; and througb this
sign did God make him an example*^" before all the creation, as
the murderer of his brother. Also did God bring trembling
and terror upon him, that he might see the peace in which he
was at first, and see also the trembling and terror he endured
at the last ; so that he might humble himself before God, and
repent of his sin, and seek the peace he enjoyed at first.

And [in] the word of God that said, " I will forego seven
punishments on whomsoever kills Cain,'^ God was not seeking
to kill Cain with the sword, but He sought to make him die of
fasting, and praying and weeping by hard rule, until the time
that he was delivered from his sin.

And the seven punishments are the seven generations during
which God awaited Cain for the murder of his brother.

But as to Cain, ever since he had killed his brother, he
could find no rest in any place ; but went back to Adam and
Eve, trembling, terrified, and defiled with blood.

When they saw him they grieved and wept, not knowing
whence came his trembling and terror, and the blood with
which he was bespattered.

Cain, then, came running to his sister that was bom with
him. But when she saw him, she was affrighted, and said
unto him, " 0, my brother, wherefore art thou come thus
trembling V And he said to her, " I have killed my brother
Abel in a certain place."

BOOK II.



CHAPTER I.

When Luluwa heard Cain's words, she wept and went to call
her father and mother, and told them how that Cain had killed
his brother Abel.

Then they all cried aloud and lifted up their voices, and
slapped their faces, and threw dusfc upon their heads, and rent
asunder their garments, and went out and came to the place
where Abel was killed.

And they found him lying on the earth, killed, and beasts
around him ; while they wept and cried because of this just
one. From his body, by reason of its purity, went forth a
smell of sweet spices. And Adam carried him, his tears
streaming down his face ; and went to the Cave of Tres^sures,
where he laid him, and wound him up with sweet spices and
myrrh.

And Adam and Eve continued by the burial of him in great
grief a hundred and forty days. Abel was fifteen and a half
years old, and Cain seventeen years and a half.^

As for Cain, when the mourning for his brother was ended,
he took his isister Luluwa^ and married her, without leave from
his father and mother ; for they could not keep him from her,
by reason of their heavy heart.

He then went down to the bottom of the mountain, away
from the garden, near to the place where he had killed his
brother.



II.] BIRTH OF SETE. 105

And in that place were many [fruit] trees and forest trees.
His sister bare him children, who [in their turn] began to
multiply by degrees until they filled that place.

But as for Adam and Eve, they came not together after
Abel's funeral, for seven years. After this, however. Eve
conceived ; and while she was with child, Adam said to her,
" Come, let us take an offering and offer it up unto God,
and ask Him to give us a fair child, in whom we may find
comfort, and whom we may join in marriage to AbeFs sister.

Then they prepared an offering and brought it up to the
altar, and offered it before the Lord, and began to entreat
Him to accept their offering, and to give them a good off-
spring.

And God heard Adam and accepted his offering. Then,
they worshipped, Adam, Eve, and their daughter, and came
down to the Cave of Treasures and placed a lamp in it, to burn
by night and by day, before the body of Abel.

Then Adam and Even continued fasting and praying until
Eve^s time came that she should be delivered, when she said
to Adam, " I wish to go to the cave in the rock, to bring forth
in it."

And he said, " Go, and take with thee thy daughter to wait
on thee ; but I will remain in this Cave of Treasures before the
body of my son Abel."

Then Eve hearkened to Adam, and went, she and her
daughter. But Adam remained by himself in the Cave of
Treasures.



CHAPTER II.

And Eve brought forth a son perfectly beautiful in figure
and in countenance. His beauty was like that of his father
Adam, yet more beautiful.^

Then Eve was comforted when she saw him, and remained



106 THE BOOK OF ADAM AND EVE. [book

eight days in the cave ; then she sent her daughter unto Adam
[to tell him] to come and see the child and name him. But
the daughter stayed in his place by the body of her brother,
until Adam returned. So did she.

But when Adam came and saw the child^s good looks, his
beauty, and his perfect figure, he rejoiced over him, and was
comforted for Abel. Then he named the child Seth,* that
/neans, " that God has heard my prayer, and has delivered me
out of my affliction.^' But it means also "power and strength."

Then after Adam had named the child, he returned to the
Cav-e of Treasures ; and his daughter went back to her mother.

But Eve continued in her cave, until forty days were fulfilled,
when she came to Adam, and brought with her the child and
her daughter.

And they came to a river of water, where Adam and hia
daughter washed themselves, because of their sorrow for Abel;
but Eve and the babe washed for purification.

Then they returned, and took an offering, and went to the
mountain and offered it up, for the babe; and God accepted
their offering, and sent His blessing upon them, and upon their
son Seth ; and they came back to the Cave of Treasures.

As for Adam, he knew not again his wife Eve, all the days
of his life ; neither was any more offspring born of them ; but
only those five, Cain, Luluwa, Abel, Aklia,* and Sethf alone. J

But Seth waxed in stature and in strength ; and began to
fast and pray, fervently. §

when lie saw him thus separated from her ; and strove to make
him live with her again. ^

Then Adam arose andwent np above the Cave of Treasures;
and continued to sleep there night by night. But as soon as it
was light every day he came down to the cave, to pray there
and to receive a blessing from it.

But when it was evening he went up on the roof of the cave,
where he slept by himself, fearing lest Satan should overcome
him. And he continued thus apart thirty-nine days.

Then Satan, the hater of all good, when he saw Adam thus
alone, fasting and praying, appeared unto him in the form of
a beautiful woman, who came and stood before him in the night
of the fortieth day, and said unto him : —

" Adam, from the time ye have dwelt in this cave, we
have experienced great peace from you, and your prayers have
reached us, and we have been comforted about you.

" But now, Adam, that thou hast gone up over the roof of
the cave to sleep, we have had doubts about thee, and a great
sorrow has come upon us because of thy separation from Eve.
Then again, when thou art on the roof of this cave, thy prayer
is poured out, and thy heart wanders from side to side.

" But when thou wast in the cave thy prayer was like fire
gathered together; it came down to us, and thou didst find
rest.

" Then I also grieved over thy children who are severed
from thee ; and my sorrow is great about the murder of thy
son Abel ; for he was righteous ; and over a righteous man
every one will grieve.

" But I rejoiced over the birth of thy son Seth ; yet after a
little while I sorrowed greatly over Eve, because she is my
sister. For when God sent a deep sleep over thee, and drew
her out of thy side. He brought me out also with her. But He
raised her by placing her with thee, while He lowered me.

" I rejoiced over my sister for her being with thee. But God
had made me a promise before, and said, ' Grieve not ; when



108 THE BOOK OF ADAM AND EVE. [book

Adam has gone up on the roof of the Cave of Treasures, and
is separated from Eve his wife, I will send thee to him, thou
shalt join thyself to him in marriage, and bear him five children,
as Eve did bear him five/

" And now, lo ! God^s promise to me is fulfilled ; for it is
He who has sent me to thee for the wedding ; because if thou
■wed me, I shall bear thee finer and better children than those
of Eve.

" Then again, thou art as yet but a youth ; end not thy
youth in this world in sorrow ; but spend the days of thy youth
in mirth and pleasure. For thy days are few and thy trial
is great. Be strong ; end thy days in this world in rejoicing.
I shall take pleasure in thee, and thou shalt rejoice with me in
this wise, and without fear.

" Up, then, and fulfil the command of thy God," she then
drew near to Adam, and embraced him.

But when Adam saw that he should be overcome by her, he
prayed to God with a fervent heart to deliver him from her.

Then God sent His Word unto Adam, saying, " Adam, that
figure is the one that promised thee the Godhead, and majesty;
he is not favourably disposed towards thee ; but shows himself
to thee at one time in the form of a woman ; another moment,
in the likeness of an angel; on another occasion, in the
similitude of a serpent ; and at another time, in the semblance
of a god ; but he does all that only to destroy thy soul,

" Now, therefore, Adam, understanding thy heart, I have
delivered thee many a time from his hands ; in order to show
thee that I am a merciful God ; and that I wish thy good, and
that I do not wish thy ruin." .



CHAPTER IV.

Then God ordered Satan to show himself to Adam plainly,
in his own hideous form.



11.] SATAN TEMPTS ADAM. 109

But when Adam saw him, he feared, and trembled at the
sight of him.

And God said to Adam, " Look at this devil,* and at his
hideous look, and know that he it is who made thee fall from
brightness into darkness, from peace and rest to toil and
misery. And look, O Adam, at him, who said of himself that
he is God ! Can God be black ? Would God take the form
of a woman ? Is there any one stronger than God ? And
can He be overpowered ?

" See, then, Adam, and behold him bound in thy presence,
in the air, unable to flee away ! Therefore, I say unto thee,
be not afraid of him ; henceforth take care, and beware of him,
in whatever he may do to thee,"

Then God drove Satan away from before Adam, whom He
strengthened, and whose heart He comforted, saying to him,
" Go down to the Cave of Treasures, and separate not thyself
from Eve ; I will quell in you all animal lust. From that hour
it left Adam and Eve, and they enjoyed rest by the command-
ment of God. But God did not the like to any one of Adam's
seed ; but only to Adam and Eve.

Then Adam worshipped before the Lord, for having
delivered him, and for having layed his passions. And he
came down from above the cave, and dwelt with Eve as
aforetime. This ended the forty days of his separation
from Eve.

CHAPTER V.

As for Seth, when he was seven years old, he knew good
and evil, and was consistent in fasting and praying, and spent
all his nights in entreating God for mercy and forgiveness.

He also fasted when bringing up his offering every day,
more than his father did; for he was of a fair countenance,
like unto an angel of God. He also had a good heart,

* Lit. Diabolos.



110 THE BOOK OF ADAM AND EVE. [book

preserved the finest qualities of his soul ; and for this reason
he brought up his offering every day.

And God was pleased with his offering; but He was also
pleased with his purity.* And he continued thus in [doing]
the will of God, and of his father and mother, until he was
seven years old.

After that, as he was coming down from the altar, having
ended his offering, Satan appeared unto him in the form of a
beautiful angel, brilliant with light; with a staff of light in
his hand, himself girt about with a girdle of light.

He greeted Seth with a beautiful smile, and began to
beguile him with fair words, saying to him, " Seth, why
abidest thou in this mountain ? For it is rough, full of stones
and of sand, and of trees with no good fruit on them ; a
wilderness without habitations and without towns ; no good
place to dwell in. But all is heat, weariness, and trouble."

He said further, "But we dwell in beautiful places, in
another world than this earth. Our world is one of light and
our condition isf of the best ; our women are handsomer than
any others; and I wish thee, Seth, to wed one of them;
because I see that thou art fair to look upon, and in this land
there is not one woman good enough for thee. Besides, all
those who live in this world, are only five souls.

" But in our world there are very many men and many
maidens, all more beautiful one than another. I wish, therefore,
to remove thee hence, that thou may est see my relations and
be wedded to which ever thou likest.

" Thou shalt then abide by me and be at peace ; thou shalt
be filled with splendour and light, as we are.

" Thou shalt remain in our world, and rest from this world
and the misery of it ; thou shalt never again feel faint and
weary; thou shalt never bring up an offering, nor sue for
mercy; for thou shalt commit no more sin, nor be swayed
by passions.

* Or, innocence. t ^^^- conditions are.



II.] SATAN TEMPTS SETH. Ill

" And if thou wilt hearken to what I say, thou shalt wed
one of my daughters ; for with us it is no sin so to do ; neither
is it reckoned animal lust.

" For in our world we have no God ; but we all are gods ;
we all are of the light, heavenly, powerful, strong and
glorious.''



CHAPTER VI.

When Seth heard these words he was amazed, and inclined
his heart to Satan's treacherous speech, and said to him,
" Saidst thou there is another world created than this ; and
other creatures more beautiful than the creatures that are in
this world V

And Satan said, " Yes j behold thou hast heard me ; but I
will yet praise them and their ways, in thy hearing."

But Seth said to him, " Thy speech has amazed me ; and
thy beautiful description [of it all}.

" Yet I cannot go with thee to-day ; not until I have goue
to my father Adam and to my mother Eve, and told them all
thou hast said to me. Then if they give me leave to go with
thee, I will come."

Again Seth said, " I am afraid of doing any thing without
my father's and mother's leave, lest I perish like my brother
Cain, and like my father Adam, who transgressed the com-
mandment of God. But, behold, thou knowest this place ;
come, and meet me here to-morrow."

When Satan heard this, he said to Seth, '* If thou tellest
thy father Adam what I have told thee, he will not let thee
come with me. But hearken to me; do not tell thy father
and mother what I have said to thee ; but come with me to-
day, to our world ; where thou shalb see beautiful things and
enjoy thyself there, and revel this day among my children,
beholding them and taking thy fill of mirth ; and rejoice ever-



112 THE BOOK OF ADAM AND EVE. [book

more. Then I shall bring thee back to this place to-morrow ;
but if thou wouldest rather abide with me, so be it."

Then Seth answered, '' The spirit of my father and of my
mother, hangs on me; and if I hide from them one day,
they will die, and God will hold me guilty of sinning against
them.*

" And except that they know I am come to this place to
bring up to it [my] offering, they would not be separated from
me one hour ; neither should I go to any other place, unless
they let me. But they treat me most kindly, because I come
back to them quickly."

Then Satan said to him, " What will happen to thee if thou
hide thyself from them one night, and return to them at break
of day?"

But Seth, when he saw how he kept on talking, and that he
would not leave him — ran, and went up to the altar, and spread
his hands unto God, and sought deliverance from Him.

Then God sent His Word, and cursed Satan, who fled from
Him.

But as for Seth, he had gone up to the altar, saying thus in
his heart, " The altar is the place of offering, and God is there ;
a divine fire shall consume it ; so shall Satan be unable to hurt
me, and shall not take me away thence."

Then Seth came down from the altar and went to his father
and mother, whom he found in the way, longing to hear his
voice ; for he had tarried a while.

He then began to tell them what had befallen him from
Satan, under the form of an angel.

But when Adam heard his account, he kissed his face, and
warned him against that angel, telling him it was Satan who
thus appeared to him. Then Adam took Seth, and they went
to the Cave of Treasures, and rejoiced therein.

But from that day forth Adam and Eve never parted from

* Lit. of their sin.



II.] SETH'S MARRIAGE. 113

him^ to whatever place he might go, whether for his ofEering
or for any thing else.

This sign happened to Seth, when he was nine years old.

CHAPTER VII.

When our father Adam saw that Seth was of a perfect heart,
he wished him to marry ; lest the enemy should appear to him
another time, and overcome him.

So Adam said to his son Seth, " I wish, my son, that thou
wed thy sister Aklia, Abel's sister, that she may bear thee
children, who shall replenish the earth, according to God's
promise to us.

*' Be not afraid, my son ; there is no disgrace in it. I wish
thee to marry, from fear lest the enemy overcome thee.**

Seth, however, did not wish to marry ; but in obedience to
his father and mother, he said not a word.

So Adam married him to Aklia.* And he was fifteen
years old.

But when he was twenty years of age,t he begat a son,
whom he called Enos;J and then begat other children than
him.

Then Enos grew up, married, and begat Cainan.

Cainan also grew up, married, and begat Mahalaleel.

Those fathers were born during Adam*s life-time, and dwelt
by the Cave of Treasures.

Then were the days of Adam nine hundred and thirty years,

and those of Mahalaleel one hundred. But Mahalaleel, when

he was grown up, loved fasting, praying, and with hard labour,§

until the end of our father Adam*s days drew near.

114 TEE BOOK OF ADAM AND EVE. [book



CHAPTER VIII.

When our father Adam saw that his end was near,' he called
his son Seth, who came to him in the Cave of Treasures, and
he said unto him : —

*' Seth, my son, bring me thy children and thy children's
children, that I may shed my blessing on them ere I die."

When Seth heard these words from his father Adam, he
went from him, shed a flood of tears over his face,* and
gathered together his children and his children's children, and
brought them to his father Adam.

But when our father Adam saw them around him, he wept
at having to be separated from them.

And when they saw him weeping, they all wept together, and
fell upon his face saying, " How shalt thou be severed from us,
our father ? And how shall the earth receive thee and hide
thee from our eyes V Thus did they lament much, and in
like words. t

Then our father Adam blessed them all, and said to Seth,
after he had blessed them : —

" Seth, my son, thou knowest this world — that it is full of
sorrow, and of weariness ; and thou knowest all that has come
upon us, from our trials in it. I therefore now command thee
in these words : to keep innocency, to be pure and just, and
trusting in God ; and lean not to the discourses of Satan, nor
to the apparitions in which he will show himself to thee. But
keep the commandments that I give thee this day ; then give
the same to thy son Enos ; and let Enos give it to his son
Cainan ; and Cainan to his son Mahalaleel ; so that this com-
mandment abide firm among all your children.^

" Seth, my son, the moment I am dead take ye my body
and wind it up with myrrh, aloes, and cassia, and leave me here

* Lit. down his cheeki. f Or, straiuB.



II.] ADAM'S COUNSEL TO SETS. 115

in this Cave of Treasures in whicli are all these tokens which
God gave us from the garden.

*' my son, hereafter shall a flood come^ and overwhelm all
creatures, and leave out only eight souls.

" But, my son, let those whom it will leave out from
among your children at that time, take my body with them out
of this cave ; and when they have taken it with them, let the
oldest among them command his children to lay my body in a
ship until the flood has been assuaged, and they come out of
the ship. Then they shall take my body and lay it in the
middle of the earth, shortly after they have been saved from
the waters of the flood.

" For the place where my body shall be laid, is the middle of
the earth ; God shall come from thence and shall save all our
kindred.

" But now, Seth, my son, place thyself at the head of thy
people ; tend them and watch over them in the fear of God ;
and lead them in the good way. Command them to fast unto
God J and make them understand they ought not to hearken
to Satan, lest he destroy them.

" Then, again, sever thy children and thy children's children
from Cain's children ; do not let them ever mix with those,
nor come near them either in their words or in their deeds."

Then Adam let his blessing descend upon Seth, and upon
his children, and upon all his children's children.

He then turned to his son Seth, and to Eve his wife, and
said to them, " Preserve this gold, this incense, and this myrrh,
that God has given us for a sign ; for in days that are coming,
a flood will overwhelm the whole creation. But those who
shall go into the ark shall take with them the gold, the incense,
and the myrrh, together with my body; and will lay the gold,
the incense, and the myrrh, with my body in the midst of the
earth.

" Then, after a long time, the city in which the gold, the
incense, and the myrrh are found with my body, shall be plun-

8 *



116 THE BOOK OF ADAM AND EVE. [book

dered. But when it is spoiled, the gold, the incense, and the
myrrh shall be taken care of with the spoil that is kept ; and
naught of them shall perish, until the Word of God, made
man shall come ; when kings shall take them,* and shall offer
to Him, gold in token of His being King ; incense, in token of
His being God of heaven and earth ; and myrrh, in token of
His passion.

" Gold also, as a token of His overcoming Satan, and all our
foes ; incense as a token that He will rise from the dead, and
be exalted above things in heaven and things in the earth ; and
myrrh, in token that He will drink bitter gall ; and [feel] the
pains of hell from Satan.

''And now, Seth, my son, behold I have revealed unto
thee hidden mysteries, which God had revealed unto me. Keep
my commandment, for thyself, and for thy people.'*



CHAPTER IX.

When Adam had ended his commandment to Seth, his limbs
were loosened, his hands and feet lost all power, his mouth
became dumb, and his tongue ceased altogether to speak. He
closed his eyes and gave up the ghost.^

But when his children saw that he was dead, they threw
themselves over him, men and women, old and young, weeping.

The death of Adam took place at the end of nine hundred
and thirty years that he lived upon the earth ; on the fifteenth
day of Barmudeh, after the reckoning of an epact of the sun, at
the ninth hour. It was on a Friday,^° the very day on which he
was created, and on which he rested ; and the hour at which he
died, was the same as that at which he came out of the garden.

Then Seth wound him up well, and embalmed him with
plenty of sweet spices, from sacred trees and from the Holy

* i.e., the gold, the incense, and the myrrh.



II.] THE DEATH OF ADAM. 117

Mountain ; and he laid his body on the eastern side of the
inside of the cave, the side of the incense ; and placed in front
of him a lamp-stand kept burning.

Then his children stood before him weeping and wailing over
him the whole night until break of day.

Then Seth and his son Enos, and Cainan, the son of Enos,
went out and took good offerings to present unto the Lord, and
they came to the altar upon which Adam offered gifts to God,
when he did offer.

But Eve said to them, " Wait until we have first asked God
to accept our offering, and to keep by Him the soul of Adam
His servant, and to take it up to rest."

And they all stood up and prayed.^^



CHAPTER X.

And when they had ended their prayer, the Word of God
came and comforted them concerning their father Adam.

After this, they offered their gifts for themselves and for
their father.

And when they had ended their offering, the Word of God
came to Seth, the eldest among them, saying unto him, " O
Seth, Seth, Seth, three times. As I was with thy father, so
also shall I be with thee, until the fulfilment of the promise I
made him — thy father [saying] , I will send My Word and save
thee and thy seed.

" But as to thy father Adam, keep thou the commandment
he gave thee; and sever thy seed from that of Cain thy
brother."

And God withdrew His Word from Seth.

Then Seth, Eve, and their children, came down from the
mountain to the Cave of Treasures.

Bat Adam was the first whose soul died in the land of



118 THE BOOK OF ADAM AND EVE. [book

Eden,* in the Cave of Treasures ; for no one died before him,
but his son Abel, who died murdered.

Then all the children of Adam rose up, and wept over their
father Adam, and made offerings to him, one hundred and
forty days.



CHAPTER XI.

After the death of Adam and of Eve,^' Seth severed his
children, and his children's children, from Cain's children.
Cain and his seed went down and dwelt westward, below the
place where he had killed his brother Abel.^*

But Seth and his children, dwelt northwards upon the
mountain of the Cave of Treasures, in order to be near to their
father Adam. And Seth the elder, tall and good, with a fine
soul, and of a strong mind, stood at the head of his people j
and tended them in innocence, penitence, and meekness, and
did not allow one of them to go down to Cain's children. But
because of their own purity, they were named " Children of
God," and they were with God, instead of the hosts of angels
who fell ; for they continued in praises to God, and in singing
psalms unto Him, in their cave — the Cave of Treasures.

Then Seth stood before the body of his father Adam, and of
his mother Eve, and prayed night and day, and asked for
mercy towards himself and his children ; and that when he had
some difficult dealing with a child. He would give him counsel.

But Seth and his children did not like earthly work, but
gave themselves to heavenly things ;^* for they had no other
thought than praises, doxologies, and psalms unto God. There-
fore did they at all times hear the voices of angels, praising
and glorifying God; from within the garden, or when they
were sent [by God] on an errand, or when they were going
up to heaven.

* In the land in which he was created (the land of Eden). Eafale, p. 19.



n.] TEE CHILDREN OF SETS. 119

For Seth and his children, by reason of their own purity,
heard and saw those angels. Then, again, the garden was not
far above them, but only some fifteen spiritual cubits. Now
one spiritual cubit answers to three cubits of man ;* altogether
forty-five cubits.

Seth and his children dwelt on the mountain below the
garden ; they sowed not, neither did they reap ; they wrought
no food for the body, not even wheat; but only offerings.
They ate of the fruit and of trees well flavoured [that grew] on
the mountain where they dwelt.

Then Seth often fasted every forty days, as did also his eldest
children. For the family of Seth smelled the smell of the trees
in the garden, when the wind blew [that way] . They were
happy, innocent, without sudden fear, there was no jealousy,
no evil action, no hatred among them. There was no animal
passion ; from no mouth among them went forth either foul
words or curse ; neither evil counsel nor fraud. For the men
of that time never swore, but under hard circumstances, when
men must swear, they swore by the blood of Abel the just.f

But they constrained their children and their women every
day in the cave to fast and pray, and to worship the most High
God. They blessed themselves in the body of their father
Adam, and anointed themselves with it. And they did so
until the end of Seth drew near.



CHAPTER XII.

Then Seth, the just, called his son Bnos, and Cainan, son of
Enos, and Mahalaleel, son of Cainan, and said unto them :—

" As ray end is near, I wish to build a roof over the altar on
which gifts are offered.'*

* Lit. of the arm.

t They dwelt on Mount Hermon leading a life of purity, and abstaining from
marriage; wherefore were they called Watchers and Sons of Ood. Bar. Ilebr. Pyn.,
p. 4.



120 THE BOOK OF ADAM AND EVE. [book

They hearkened to his commandment and went out, all of
them, both old and young, and worked hard at it, and built a
beautiful roof over the altar.

And Seth's thought, in so doing, was that a blessing should
come upon his children on the mountain ; and that he should
present an offering for them before his death.

Then when the building of the roof was completed, he com-
manded them to make offerings. They worked diligently at
these, and brought them to Seth their father, who took them
and offered them upon the altar ; and prayed God to accept
their offerings, to have mercy on the souls of his children, and
to keep them from the hand of Satan.

And God accepted his offering, and sent His blessing upon
him and upon his children. And then God made a promise to
Seth, saying, " At the end of the great five days and a half,
concerning which I have made a promise to thee and to
thy father, I will send My Word and save thee and thy
seed."

Then Seth and his children, and his children's children, met
together, and came down from the altar, and went to the
Cave of Treasures — where they prayed, and blessed themselves
in the body of our father Adam, and anointed themselves
with it.

But Seth abode in the Cave of Treasures, a few days, and
then suffered-^sufferings unto death.

Then Enos, his first-born son, came to him, with Cainan,
his son, and Mahalaleel, Cainan's son, and Jared, the son of
Mahalaleel, and Enoch, Jared's son, with their wives and
children to receive a blessing from Seth.

Then Seth prayed over them, and blessed them, and
adjured them by the blood of Abel the just,^^ saying, " I beg
of you, my children, not to let one of you go down from this
Holy and pure Mountain. Make no fellowship with the
children of Cain the murderer and the sinner, who killed his
brother ; for ye know, my children, that we flee from him.



II.] LAMEGH TEE BLIND. 121

and from all his sin with all our might because he killed his
brother Abel/'

After having said this, Seth blessed Enos, his first- bom son,
and commanded him habitually to minister in purity before
the body of our father Adam, all the days of his life ; then,
also, to go at times to the altar which he [Seth] had built.
And he commanded him to feed his people in righteousness,
in judgment and purity all the days of his life.

Then the limbs of Seth were loosened ; his hands and feet
lost all power ; his mouth became dumb, and unable to speak ;
and he gave up the ghost and died the day after his nine
hundred and twelfth year ; on the twenty-seventh day of the
month Abib ; Enoch being then twenty years old.

Then they wound up carefully the body, of Seth, and
embalmed him with sweet spices, and laid him in the Cave of
Treasures, on the right side of our father Adam's body, and
they mourned for him forty days. They offered gifts for him,
as they had done for our father Adam.

After the death of Seth, Enos rose at the head of his people,
whom he fed in righteousness, and judgment, as his father had
commanded him.^^

But by the time Enos was eight hundred and twenty years
old, Cain had a large progeny ; for they married frequently,
being given to animal lusts; until the land below the mountain,
was filled with them.



CHAPTER XIII.

In those days lived Lamech the blind, who was of the sons
of Cain. He had a son whose name was Atun,* and they two
had much cattle.

But Lamech was in the habit of sending them [to feed] with
a young shepherd,t who tended them ; and who, when coming
* In Arabic, it means hot, hard, hasty. t Lamech 's grandson.



122 THE BOOK OF ADAM AND EVE. [book

home in the evening wept before his grandfather, and before
his father Atun and his mother Hazina, and said to them, "As
for me, I cannot feed those cattle alone, lest one rob me of
some of them, or kill me for the sake of them." For among
the children of Cain, there was much robbery, murder, and
sin.

Then Lamech pitied him, and he said, ''Truly, he [when
alone], might be overpowered by the [men of this place.]'*

So Lamech arose, took a bow he had kept ever since he was
a youth, ere he became blind, and he took large arrows, and
smooth stones, and a sling which he had, and went to the
field with the young shepherd, and placed himself behind the
cattle; while the young shepherd watched the cattle. Thus
did Lamech many days.

Meanwhile Cain, ever since God had cast him ofi", and had
cursed him with trembling and terror, could neither settle nor
find rest in any one place ; but wandered from place to place.

[In his wanderings] he came to Lamech's wives, and asked
them about him. They said to him, ''He is in the field with
the cattle."

Then Cain went to look for him ; and [as] he came into the
field, the young shepherd heard the noise he made, and the
cattle herding together from before him.

Then said he to Lamech, " O my lord, is that a wild beast
or a robber ? "

And Lamech said to him, " Make me understand which way
he looks, when he comes up."

Then Lamech bent his bow, placed an arrow on it, and
fitted a stone in the sling, and when Cain came out from the
open country, the shepherd said to Lamech, " Shoot, behold,
he is coming."

Then Lamech shot at Cain with his arrow and hit him in his
side. And Lamech struck him with a stone from his sling,
that fell upon his face, and knocked out both his eyes ; then
Cain fell at once and died.^''



II.] LIFE AND DEATH OF EN08. 123

Then Lamech and the young shepherd came up to him, and
found him lying on the ground. And the young shepherd
said to him, *' It is Cain our grandfather, whom thou hast
killed, my lord ! "

Then was Lamech sorry for it, and from the bitterness of
his regret, he clapped his hands together, and struck with his
flat palm the head of the youth, who fell as if dead; but
Lamech thought it was a feint ; so he took up a stone and
smote him, and smashed his head until he died.^^



CHAPTER XIV.

When Enos was nine hundred years old, all the children of
Seth, and of Cainan, and his first-born, with their wives and
children, gathered around him, asking for a blessing from
him.

He then prayed over them and blessed them, and adjured
them by the blood of Abel the just, saying to them, " Let not
one of your children go down from this Holy Mountain, and
let them make no fellowship with the children of Cain the
murderer."

Then Enos called his son Cainan and said to him, " See, O
my son, and set thy heart on thy people, and establish them in
righteousness, and in innocence ; and stand ministering before
the body of our father Adam, all the days of thy life."

After this Enos entered into rest, aged nine hundred and
eighty-five years ; and Cainan wound him up, and laid him in
the Cave of Treasures on the left of his father Adam; and
made offerings for him, after the custom of his fathers.

CHAPTER XV.

After the death of Enos, Cainan stood at the head of his
people in righteousness and innocence, as his father had



124 THE BOOK OF ADAM AND EVE. [book

commatided him; he also continued to minister before the
body of Adam, inside the Cave of Treasures.^'

Then when he had hved nine hundred and ten years,
suffering and affliction came upon him. And when he was
about to enter into rest, all the fathers with their wives and
children came to him, and he blessed them, and adjured them
by the blood of Abel the just^^ saying to them, " Let not one
among you go down from this Holy Mountain ; and make no
fellowship with the children of Cain the murderer/'

Mahalaleel, his first-born son, received this commandment
from his father, who blessed him and died.

Then Mahalaleel embalmed him with sweet spices, and laid
him in the Cave of Treasures, with his fathers ; and they made
oflferings for him, after the custom of their fathers.*



CHAPTER XVI.

Then Mahalaleel stood over his people, and fed them in
righteousness and innocence, and watched them to see they
held no intercourse with the childreji of Cain.

He also continued in the Cave of Treasures praying and
ministering before the body of our father Adam, asking God
for mercy on himself and on his people ; until he was eight
hundred and seventy years old, when he fell sick.

Then all his children gathered unto him, to see him, and to
ask for his blessing on them all, ere he left this world.

Then Mahalaleel arose and sat on his bed, his tears streaming
down his face, and he called his eldest son Jared, who came to
him.

He then kissed his face, and said to him, " Jared, my
son, I adjure thee by Him who made heaven and earth, f to

children go down from the mountain to the children of Cain the accursed. Eutych.

II.] DEATH OF MAHALALEEL. 125

watch over thy people, and to feed them in righteousness and
in innocence ; and not to let one of them go down from this
Holy Mountain to the children of Cain, lest he perish with them.
" Hear, O my son, hereafter there shall come a great destruc-
tion upon this earth on account of them ; God will be angry
with the world, and will destroy them with waters.

" But I also know that thy children will not hearken to
thee, and that they will go down from this mountain and hold
intercourse with the children of Cain, and that they shall
perish with them.

'* O my son ! teach them, and watch over them, that no guilt
attach to thee on their account.^'

Mahalaleel said, moreover, to his son Jared, " When I die,
embalm my body and lay it in the Cave of Treasures, by the
bodies of my fathers ; then stand thou by my body and pray to
God ; and take care of them, and fulfil thy ministry before
them, until thou enterest into rest thyself."

Mahalaleel then blessed all his children ; and then lay down
on his bed, and entered into rest like his fathers.

But when Jared saw that his father Mahalaleel was dead, he
wept, and sorrowed, and embraced and kissed his hands and his
feet ; and so did all his children.

And his children embalmed him carefully, and laid him by
the bodies of his fathers. Then they arose, and mourned for
him forty days.



CHAPTER XVII.

Then Jared kept his father's commandment, and arose like
a lion over his people. He fed them in righteousness and
innocence, and commanded them to do nothing without his
counsel. For he was afraid concerning them, lest they should
go to the children of Cain.



126 TEE BOOK OF ADAM AND EVE. [book

Wherefore did he give them orders repeatedly ; and con-
tinued to do so until the end of the four hundred and eighty-
fifth year of his life.

At the end of these said years, there came unto him this
sign. As Jared was standing like a lion before the bodies of his
fathers, praying and warning his people, Satan envied him, and
wrought a beautiful apparition, because Jared would not let
his children do aught without his counsel.

Satan then appeared to him with thirty men of his hosts, in
the form of handsome men ; Satan himself being the elder and
tallest among them, with a fine beard.

They stood at the mouth of the cave, and called out Jared,
from within it.

He came out to them, and found them looking like fine men,
full of light, and of great beauty. He wondered at their
beauty and [at their] looks ; and thought within himself
whether they might not be of the children of Cain.

He said also in his heart, " As the children of Cain cannot
come up to the height of this mountain, and none of them is so
handsome as these appear to be ; and among these men there
is not one of my kindred — they must be strangers.^'

Then Jared and they exchanged a greeting, and he said to
the elder among them, " my father, explain to me the wonder
that is in thee, and tell me who these are, with thee ; for they
look to me like strange men."

Then the elder began to weep, and the rest wept with him ;
and he said to Jared, " I am Adam whom God made first ; and
this is Abel my son, who was killed by his brother Cain, into
whose heart Satan put to murder him.

" Then this is my son Seth, whom I asked of the Lord, who
gave him to me, to comfort me instead of Abel.

" Then this one is my son Enos, son of Seth, and that other
one is Cainan, son of Enos, and that other one is Mahalaleel,
son of Cainan, thy father.^'

But Jared remained wondering at their appearance, and at
the speech of the elder to him.



II.] SATAN APPEARS TO JARED. 127

Then the elder said to him, "Marvel not, my son; we
live in the land north of the garden, which God created before
the world. He would not let us live there, but placed us inside
the garden, below which ye are now dwelling.

" But, after that I transgressed. He made me come out of it,
and I was left to dwell in this cave ; great and sore troubles
came upon me ; and when my death drew near, I commanded
my son Seth to tend his people well ; and this my command-
ment is to be handed from one to another, unto the end of the
generations to come.

" But, O Jared, my son, we live in beautiful regions, while
you live here in misery, as this thy father Mahalaleel informed
me ; telling me that a great flood will come and overwhelm the
whole earth.

" Therefore, O my son, fearing for your sakes, I rose and
took my children with me, and came hither for us to visit thee
and thy children; but I found thee standing in this cave
weeping, and thy children scattered about this mountain, in
the heat and in misery.

" But, O my son, as we missed our way, and came as far as
this, we found other men below this mountain ; who inhabit a
beautiful country, full of trees and of fruits, and of all manner
of verdure ; it is like a garden ; so that when we found them
we thought they were you; until thy father Mahalaleel told me
they were no such thing.

" Now, therefore, O my son, hearken to my counsel, and go
down to them, thou and thy children. Ye will rest from all
this suffering in which ye are. But if thou wilt not go down to
them, then, arise, take thy children, and come with us to our
garden ; ye shall live in our beautiful land, and ye shall rest
from all this trouble, which thou and thy children are now
bearing."

But Jared when he heard this discourse from the elder,
wondered ; and went hither and thither, but at that moment
he found not one of his children.



128 THE BOOK OF ADAM AND EVE. [book

Then he answered and said to the elder, " Why have you
hidden yourselves until this day ? "

And the elder replied, " If thy father had not told us, we
should not have known it."

Then Jared believed his words were true.

So the elder said to Jared, " Wherefore didst thou turn
about, so and so ? " And he said, " I was seeking one of my
children, to tell him about my going with you, and about their
coming down to those about whom thou hast spoken to me.'*

When the elder heard Jared's intention, he said to him,
" Let alone that purpose at present, and come with us ; thou
shalt see our country ; if the land in which we dwell pleases
thee, we and thou shall return hither and take thy family with
us. But if our country does not please thee, thou shalt come
back to thine own place. '■'

And the elder urged Jared, to go before one of his children
came to counsel him [otherwise] .

Jared, then, came out of the cave and went with them, and
among them. And they comforted him, until they came to the
top of the mountain of the sons of Cain.

Then said the elder to one of his companions, " We have
forgotten something by the mouth of the cave, and that is, the
chosen garment we had brought to clothe Jared withal/'

He then said to one of them, " Go back, thou, some one ;
and we will wait for thee here, until thou come back. Then
will we clothe Jared, and he shall be like us, good, handsome,
and fit to come with us into our country."

Then that one went back.

But when he was a short distance oflP, the elder called to him
and said to him, " Tarry thou, until I come up and speak to
thee."

Then he stood still, and the elder went up to him and said
to him, " One thing we forgot at the cave, it is this — to put out
the lamp that bums inside it, above the bodies that are therein.
Then come back to us, quick."



II.] JARED AMONG THE SONS OF GAIN. 129

That one went, and the elder came back to his fellows and
to Jared. And they came down from the mountain, and Jared
with them ; and they stayed by a fountain of water, near the
houses of the children of Cain, and waited for their companion
until he brought the garment [for Jared] .

He, then, who went back [to the cave], put out the lamp,
and came to them and brought a phantom with him and showed
it them. And when Jared saw it he wondered at the beauty
and grace thereof, and rejoiced in his heart, believing it was
all true.

But while they were staying there, three of them went into
houses of the sons of Cain, and said to them, " Bring us to-day
some food by the fountain of water, for us and our companions
to eat."

But when the sons of Cain saw them, they wondered at them
and thought :* " These are beautiful to look at, and such as we
never saw before." So they rose and came with them to the
fountain of water, to see their companions.

They found them so very handsome, that they cried aloud
about their places for others to gather together and come and
look at these beautiful beings. Then they gathered around
them both men and women.

Then the elder said to them, " We are strangers in your
land, bring us some good food and drink, you and your women,
to refresh ourselves with you."

When those men heard these words of the elder, every one
of Cain's sons brought his wife, and another brought his
daughter, and so, many women came to them; every one
addressing Jared either for himself or for his wife ; all alike.

But when Jared saw what they did, his very soul wrenched
itself from them ; neither would he taste of their food or of
their drink.

The elder saw him as he wrenched himselff from them, and

* Lit. said in their thoughts.

t Or, his soul wrenched itself from them.



130 THE BOOK OF ADAM AND EVE. [book

said to him, " Be not sad ; I am the great elder, as thou shalt
see me do, do thyself in like manner."

Then he spread his hands and took one of the women, and
five of his companions did the same before Jared, that he
should do as they did.

But when Jared saw them working infamy he wept, and said
in his mind,* — My fathers never did the like.

He then spread his hands and prayed with a fervent heart,
and with much weeping, and entreated God to deliver him
from their hands.

No sooner did Jared begin to pray than the elder fled with
his companions ; for they could not abide in a place of prayer.

Then Jared turned round but could not see them, but found
himself standing in the midst of the children of Cain.

He then wept and said, " O God, destroy me not with this
race, concerning which my fathers have warned me ; for now,
O my Lord God, I was thinking that those who appeared unto
me were my fathers ; but I have found them out to be devils,
who allured me by this beautiful apparition, until I believed
them.

"But now I ask Thee, God, to deliver me from this race,
among whom I am now staying, as Thou didst deliver me from
those devils. Send Thy angel to draw me out of the midst of
them ; for I have not myself power to escape from among
them."

When Jared had ended his prayer, God sent His angel in
the midst of them, who [took Jared] and set him upon the
mountain, and showed him the way, gave him counsel, and then
departed from him.

CHAPTER XYHI.

The children of Jared were in the habit of visiting him hour
after hour, to receive his blessing and to ask his advice for

II.] JARED RETURNS TO TEE MOUNTAIN. 131

every thing they did ; and when he had a work to do, they did
it for him.

But this time when they went into the cave they found not
Jared, but they found the lamp put out, and the bodies of the
fathers thrown about, and voices came from them by the power
of God, that said, " Satan in an apparition has deceived our
son, wishing to destroy him, as he destroyed our son Cain."

They said also, " Lord God of heaven and earth, deliver our
son from the hand of Satan, who wrought a great and false
apparition before him." They also spake of other matters, by
the power of God.

But when the children of Jared heard these voices they
feared, and stood weeping for their father ; for they knew not
what had befallen him.

And they wept for him that day until the setting of the
sun.

Then came Jared with a woeful countenance, wretched in
mind and body, and sorrowful at having been separated from
the bodies of his fathers.

But as he was drawing near to the cave, his children saw
him, and hastened to the cave, and hung upon his neck, crying,
and saying to him, " father, where hast thou been, and [why
hast thou] left us, as thou wast not wont to do ?" And again,
" father, when thou didst disappear, the lamp over the
bodies of our fathers went out, the bodies were thrown about,
and voices came from them."

When Jared heard this he was sorry, and went into the
cave J and there found the bodies thrown about, the lamp put
out, and the fathers themselves praying for his deliverance
from the hand of Satan.

Then Jared fell upon the bodies and embraced them, and
said, " O my fathers, through your intercession, let God
deliver me from the hand of Satan ! And I beg you will
ask God to keep me and to hide me from him unto the day of
my death." ^

9*



132 THE BOOK OF ADAM AND EVE. [book

Then all the voices ceased save the voice of our father Adam,
who spake to Jared by the power of God, just as one would
speak to his fellow, saying, " Jared my son, offer gifts to
God for having delivered thee from the hand of Satan ; and
when thou bringest those offerings, so be it, that thou offerest
them on the altar on which I did offer. Then also, beware of
Satan ; for he deluded me many a time with his apparitions,
wishing to destroy me, but God delivered me out of his hand.

" Command thy people that they be on their guard against
him ; and never cease to offer up gifts to God."

Then the voice of Adam also became silent ; and Jared and
his children wondered at this. Then they laid the bodies [as
they were at first] j and Jared and his children stood praying
the whole of that night, until break of day.

Then Jared made an offering and offered it up on the altar,
as Adam had commanded him. And as he went up to the
altar, he prayed to God for mercy and for forgiveness of his sin,
concerning the lamp going out.

Then God appeared unto Jared on the altar and blessed him
and his children, and accepted their offerings ; and commanded
Jared to take of the sacred fire from the altar, and with it to
light the lamp that shed light on the body of Adam.

CHAPTER XIX.

Then God revealed to him again the promise He had made to
Adam ; He explained to him the 5500 years, and revealed
unto him the mystery of His coming upon the earth.

And God said to Jared, "As to that fire which thou hast
taken from the altar to light the lamp withal, let it abide with
you to give light to the bodies; and let it not come out of
the cave, until the body of Adam comes out of it.

But, Jared, take care of the fire, that it burn bright in
the lamp ; neither go thou again out of the cave, until thou

receivest [an order] through a vision, and not in an apparition,
when seen by thee.

" Then command again thy people not to hold intercourse
with the children of Cain, and not to learn their ways ; for I am
God who loves not hatred and works of iniquity/'

God gave also many other commandments to Jared, and
blessed him. And then withdrew His word from him.

Then Jared drew near with his children, took some fire,
and came down to the cave, and lighted the lamp before the
body of Adam; and he gave his people commandments as
God had told him to do.

This sign happened to Jared at the end of his four hundred
and fiftieth year ; as did also many other wonders, we do not
record. But we record only this one for shortness sake, and
in order not to lengthen our narrative.

And Jared continued to teach his children eighty years ; but
after that they began to transgress the commandments he had
given them, and to do many things without his counsel. They
began to go down from the Holy Mountain one after another,
and to mix with the children of Cain, in foul fellowships.

Now the reason for which the children of Jared went down
the Holy Mountain, is this, that we will now reveal unto
you.

CHAPTER XX.

After Cain had gone down to the land of dark soil,* and his
children had multiplied therein,t there was one of them, whose
name was Genun,^^ son of Lamech the blind who slew Cain.

But as to this Genun, Satan came into him in his childhood ;
and he made sundry trumpets and horns, and string instru-

mentSj cymbals and psalteries, and lyres and harps, and flutes ;
and he played on them at all times and at every hour.*"

And when he played on them, Satan came into them, so
that from among them were heard beautiful and sweet sounds,
that ravished the heart. f

Then he gathered companies upon companies to play on
them ; and when they played, it pleased well the children of
Cain,J who inflamed themselves with sin among themselves,
and burnt as with fire ; while Satan inflamed their hearts one
with another, and increased lust among them.

Satan also taught Grenun to bring strong drink out of com ;§
and this Genun used to bring together companies upon com-
panies in drink-houses; and brought into their hands all
manner of fruits and flowers ; and they drank together.

Thus did this Genun multiply sin exceedingly; he also
acted with pride, and taught the children of Cain to commit all
manner of the grossest wickedness, which they knew not; and
put them up to manifold doings which they knew not before.

Then Satan, when he saw that they yielded to Genun and
hearkened to him in every thing he told them, rejoiced greatly
increased Genun's understanding, until he took iron and with it
made weapons of war.

Then when they were drunk, hatred and murder increased
among them j one man used violence against another to teach
him [evil], taking his children and defiling them before him.

And when men saw they were overcome, and [saw] others
that were not overpowered, those who were beaten came to
Genun, took refuge with him, and he made them his con-
federates.

Then sin increased among them greatly ; until a man married
his own sister, or daughter, or mother, and others ; or the
daughter of his father's sister, so that there was no more

distinction [of relationship],* and they no longer knew what
is iniquity ; but did wickedly, and the earth was defiled with
sin ; and they angered God the Judge, who had created them.

But Genun gathered together companies upon companies,
that played on horns and on all the other instruments we have
already mentioned, at the foot of the Holy Mountain ; and they
did so in order that the children of Seth who were on the Holy
Mountain should hear it.

But when the children of Seth heard the noise, they
wondered, and came by companies, and stood on the top of
the mountain to look at those below; and they did thus a
whole year.

When, at the end of that year, Genun saw that they were
being won over to him little by little, Satan entered into him,
and taught him to make dyeing-stuffs for garments of divers
patterns, and made him understand how to dye crimson and
purple, and what not.

And the sons of Cain who wrought all this, and shone in
beauty and gorgeous apparel, gathered together at the foot of
the mountain in splendour, with horns and gorgeous dresses,
and horse races ; committing all manner of abominations.

Meanwhile the children of Seth, who were on the Holy
Mountain, prayed and praised God, in the place of the hosts
[of angels] who had fallen; wherefore God had called them
** angels," because He rejoiced over them greatly.

But after this, they no longer kept His commandment, nor
held by the promise He had made to their fathers ; but they
relaxed from their fasting and praying, and from the counsel
of Jared their father. And they kept on gathering together
on the top of the mountain, to look upon the children of Cain,
from morning until evening, and upon what they did, upon
their beautiful dresses and ornaments.

Then the children of Cain looked up from below, and saw

* Until they knew not either parents or children. Entych., Nazam alrj., p. 26.



136 THE BOOK OF ADAM AND EVE. [book

the children of Seth, standing in troops on the top of the
mountain ; and they called to them to come down to them.

But the children of Seth said to them from above, "We
don't know the way." Then Genun, the son of Lamech, heard
them say they did not know the way, and he bethought himself
how he might bring them down.

Then Satan appeared to him by night, saying, " There is no
way for them to come down from the mountain on which they
dwell; but when they come to-morrow, say to them, * Come ye
to the western side of the mountain ; there you will find the way
of a stream of water, that comes down to the foot of the
mountain, between two hills ; come down that way to us."

Then when it was day, Genun blew the horns and beat the
drums below the mountain, as he was wont. The children of
Seth heard it, and came as they used to do.

Then Genun said to them from down below, " Go to the
western side of the mountain, there you will find the way to
come down.''

But when the children of Seth heard these words from him,
they went back into the cave to Jared, to tell him all they
had heard.

Then when Jared heard it, he was grieved; for he knew
that they would transgress Pais counsel] .

After this a hundred men of the children of Seth gathered
together,'^^ and said among themselves, " Come, let us go down
to the children of Cain, and see what they do, and enjoy
ourselves with them."

But when Jared heard this of the hundred men, his very soul
was moved, and his heart was grieved. He then arose with
great fervour, and stood in the midst of them, and adjured them
by the blood of Abel the just, " Let not one of you go down
from this holy and pure mountain, in which our fathers have
ordered us to dwell."

But when Jared saw that they did not receive his words, he
said unto them, " O my good and innocent and holy children.



II.] THE FALLEN SONS OF SETH. 137

know that when once you go down from this holy mountain,
God will not allow you to return again to it/'

He again adjured them, saying, ^'I adjure by the death of
our father Adam, and by the blood of Abel, of Seth, of Enos,
of Cainan, and of Mahalaleel, to hearken to me, and not to go
down from this holy mountain ; for the moment you leave it,
you will be reft of life and of mercy ;* and you shall no longer
be called * children of God,' but ' children of the devil/ "f

But they would not hearken to his words.

Enoch at that time was already grown up, and in his zeal for
God, he arose and said, " Hear me, ye sons of Seth, small
and great — when ye transgress the commandment of our fathers,
and go down from this holy mountain — ye shall not come up
hither again for ever.''^*

• But they rose up against Enoch, and would not hearken to
his words, but went down from the Holy Mountain.

And when they looked at the daughters of Cain, at their
beautiful figure, and at their hands and feet dyed with colour,
and tattooed in ornaments on their faces, J the fire of sin was
kindled in them.§

Then Satan made them look most beautiful before the sons
of Seth, as he also made the sons of Seth appear of the fairest
in the eyes of the daughters of Cain, so that the daughters of
Cain lusted after the sons of Seth like ravenous beasts, and the
sons of Seth after the daughters of Cain, until they committed
abomination with them.]]

But after they had thus fallen into this defilement, they
returned by the way they had come, and tried to ascend the

Holy Mountain. But they could not, because the stones of that
holy mountain were of fire flashing before them, by reason of
which they could not go up again.^^

And God was angry with them, and repented of them,
because they had come down from glory, and had thereby [lost
or] forsaken their own purity [or innocence], and were fallen^
into the defilement of sin.^^

Then God sent His Word to Jared, saying, "These thy
children, whom thou didst call ' My children,' — behold they have
transgressed My commandment, and have gone down to the
abode of perdition, and of sin. Send a messenger to those that
are left, that they may not go down, and be lost."

Then Jared wept before the Lord, and asked of Him mercy
and forgiveness. But he wished that his soul might depart
from his body, rather than hear these words from God about
the going down of his children from the Holy Mountain.

But he followed God's order, and preached unto them not to
go down from that holy mountain, and not to hold intercourse
with the children of Cain.

But they heeded not his message, and would not obey his
counsel.

CHAPTER XXI.

After this another company gathered together, and they
went to look after their brethren ; but they perished as well as
they. And so it was, company after company, until only a few
of them were left.

Then Jared sickened from grief,* and his sickness was such
that the day of his death drew near.

Then he called Enoch his eldest son, and Methuselah Enoch's
son, and Lamech the son of Methuselah, and Noah the son of
Lamech.

II.] JAREB'S LA8T WORDS TO HIS SONS. 139

And when they were come to him he prayed over them and
blessed them, and said to them, " Ye are righteous, innocent
sons ; go ye not down from this holy mountain ; for behold,
your children and your children's children have gone down
from this holy mountain, and have estranged themselves from
this holy mountain, through their abominable lust and trans-
gression of God's commandment.

" But I know, through the power of God, that He will not
leave you on this holy mountain,^^ because your children have
transgressed His commandment and that of our fathers, which
we had received from them.

''But, my sons, God will take you to a strange land, and
ye never shall again return to behold with your eyes this
garden and this holy mountain.

"Therefore, my sons, set your hearts on your own selves,*
and keep the commandment of God which is with you. And
when you go from this holy mountain, into a strange land
which ye know not, take with you the body of our father Adam,
and with it these three precious gifts and offerings, namely,
the gold, the incense, and the myrrh ; and let them be in the
place where the body of our father Adam shall lay.

'' And unto him of you who shall be left, my sons, shall
the Word of God come,^^ and when he goes out of this land
he shall take with him the body of our father Adam, and shalj
lay it in the middle of the earth, the place in which salvation
shall be wrought.''t

Then Noah said unto him, " Who is he of us that shall be
left ?"

And Jared answered, " Thou art he that shall be left.'° And
thou shalt take the body of our father Adam from the cave, and
place it with thee in the ark when the flood comes.

" And thy son Shem, who shall come out of thy loins, he it

is who shall lay the body of our father Adam in the middle of
the earth, in the place whence salvation shall come/'

Then Jared turned to his son Enoch, and said unto him,
'*Thou, my son, abide in this cave, and minister diligently*
before the body of our father Adam all the days of thy life ;
and feed thy people in righteousness and innocence."

And Jared said no more. His hands were loosened, his
eyes closed, and he entered into rest like his fathers. His
death took place in the three hundred and sixtieth year of Noah,
and in the nine hundred and eighty -ninth year of his own life ;
on the twelfth of Takhsasf on a Friday.

But as Jared died, tears streamed down his face by reason
of his great sorrow, for the children of Seth, who had fallen in
his days.

Then Enoch, Methuselah, Lamech and Noah, these four, wept
over him ; embalmed him carefully, and then laid him in the
Cave of Treasures. Then they rose and mourned for him forty
days.

And when these days of mourning were ended, Enoch,
Methuselah, Lamech and Noah remained in sorrow of heart,
because their father had departed from them, and they saw him
no more.

CHAPTER XXII.

But Enoch kept the commandment of Jared his father, and
continued to minister in the cave.

It is this Enoch to whom many wonders happened, and who
also wrote a celebrated book;J'^ but those wonders may not be
told in this place.

Then after this, the children of Seth went astray and fell,
they, their children and their wives. And when Enoch,

11.] ENOCH'S ADVICE TO HIS SONS. 141

Methuselah, Lamech and Noah saw them, their hearts suffered
by reason of their fall into doubt full of unbelief; and they
wept and sought of God mercy, to preserve them, and to bring
them out of that wicked generation.

Enoch continued in his ministry before the Lord three
hundred and eighty-five years, and at the end of that time he
became aware through the grace of God, that God intended to
remove him from the earth.

He then said to his son, "0 my son, I know that God
intends to bring the Waters of the Flood upon the earth, and to
destroy our creation.^^

" And ye are the last rulers over this people on this mountain ;
for I know that not one will be left you to beget children on
this holy mountain ; neither shall any one of you rule over the
children of his people; neither shall any great company be
left of you, on this mountain.''

Enoch said also to them, " Watch over your souls, and hold
fast by your fear of God and by your service of Him, and
worship Him in upright faith, and serve Him in righteousness,
innocence and judgment, in repentance and also in purity."^^

When Enoch had ended his commandments to them, God
transported him from that mountain to the land of life, to the
mansions of the righteous and of the chosen,^* the abode of
Paradise of joy, in light that reaches up to heaven ; light that
is outside the light of this world ; for it is the light of God,
that fills the whole world, but which no place can contain.

Thus, because Enoch* was in the light of God, he found
himself out of the reach of death ; until God would have him die.

Altogether, not one of our fathers or^ of their children,
remained on that holy mountain, except those three, Methu-
selah, Lamech, and Noah. For all the rest went down from
the mountain and fell into sin with the children of Cain.
Therefore were they forbidden that mountain, and none
remained on it but those three men.

* See S. Ephrem, vol. ii, p. 325, for a Beroion on Enoch.

BOOK III.



CHAPTER I.

Noah noticed from his youth up, how sin had multiplied,
how wickedness prevailed ; how generations of men perished,
how sorrow increased, how righteous men diminished.^

Therefore did he afflict his soul ; he restrained his members,
and retained his virginity ; and grieved over the ruin wrought
by the generations of men.

And this Noah habitually mourned and wept and was of a
sad countenance ; and thus he held his soul in fasting, so that
the enemy had no advantage over him, and did not come near
him.

This Noah also, ever since he was a child with his parents,*
never made them angry, never transgressed against them ; nor
ever did a thing without their advice. And when he was away
from them, if he wished to pray or to do aught else ; he would
ask of God, to guide him aright therein; wherefore God
watched over him.

And while he was on the mountain, he did not transgress
against God in any one evil thing, nor did he wilfully depart
from what pleased God ; neither did he ever anger God.

Many were the wonderful things which happened to him,
more than to any of his fathers before him, about the time of
the Flood.

* Lit. father.



III.] NOAH BUILDS THE ARK. 143

And Noah continued in his virginity and in his obedience to
God five hundred years ; but after that it pleased God to raise
him a seed ; He therefore spake unto him, saying, " Arise, O
Noah, and take unto thyself a wife, that of her thou mayest
have children that may be a comfort to thee ; for thou art left
alone, and thou shalt go out of this country unto a strange
land ; for the earth shall be peopled with thy posterity."

Then when Noah heard this from God, he did not transgress
His commandment, but took unto himself a wife, whose name
was Haikal, the daughter of Abaraz, who was of the children
of Enos's children, that went into perdition.

And she bare unto him three sons. Sham, Ham, and Japhet.



CHAPTER II.

After these things, God spake unto Noah about the Flood j
that it should come upon the earth, and destroy all creatures, so
as not to let one of them be seen.

And God said unto Noah, " Guard thy children ; command
them and make them understand not to have intercourse with
the children of Cain, lest they perish with them."

And Noah hearkened to God's words, and kept his children
on the mountain, and would not let them go down to the
children of Cain.

Then God spake again unto Noah, saying, "Make unto
thyself an ark of wood that will not rot ; to be a deliverance to
thee and to the men of thy house.^

" But begin to build it in the low land of Eden, in presence
of the children of Cain, that they may see thee working at it ;
and if they will not repent they shall perish ; and the blame
shall rest on them.

" But cut on this holy mountain, the trees whereof thou shalt
make the ark; let the length of the ark be three hundred



144 THE BOOK OF ADAM AND EVE. [book

cubits, the breadth thereof fifty cubits, and the height thereof
thirty cubits.^

" And when thou hast made and finished it, let there be in it
ons door above, and three compartments ;* and every compart-
ment ten cubits high.

" The first story shall be for lions, and beasts, animals and
ostriches all together. The second story shall be for birds,
and creeping things.

'' And the third story shall be for thee and thy wife, and for
thy sons and their wives.

" And make in the ark wells for water, and openings to
them, to draw water thereat, for drink to thee and to those
that are with thee. And thou shalt line those wells with lead,
both in and out.

" And make in the ark store-houses for corn ; for food to
thee and to those that are with thee.

" Then make also unto thyself a trumpet* of ebony wood,
three cubits long, one and a half cubit wide, with a mouth-
piece of the same wood.

" And thou shalt blow it three times ; the first time in the
morning, that the workmen [working] at the ark may hear it,
and gather to their work. Then thou shalt blow it the second
time, and when the workmen hear it, they will gather to their
meal. And thou shall blow it a third time in the evening, for
the workmen to go and rest from their labour.'*

And God said unto Noah, " Go about among the people and
tell them that a flood shall come and shall overwhelm them ;
and make the ark before their eyes.

" And when they question thee about the making of the ark,
tell them : God has commanded me to make it, that we may
get into it, I and my children, and be saved from the waters
of the Flood."

But when Noah went about among them and told them, they

* Or, stories.



III.] DEATH OF LAMEGH. 145

laughed at him, and only committed adultery and revelled
together all the more, and said, ''That twaddling old man !
Whence will ever the waters come, above the tops of high
mountains ? We never saw water rise above mountains ; and
this old man says, a flood is coming ! "

But Noah did all his works, as God had told him concerning
them.



CHAPTER III.

And Noah begat his three sons, during the first hundred
years he worked at the ark.

During these hundred years he ate no food, whence blood
flows ; the shoes on his feet were neither changed, nor worn,
nor grown old.

During these hundred years also, he did not change his
garments from off him, neither did they wear out, in the least ;
he did not change the staff in his hand, nor did the cloth about
his head grow old ; and the hair of his head neither increased
nor grew less.

As to those three sons of Noah, the first of them is Shem ;
the next is Ham; and the third is Japhet. They married
wives from among the daughters of Methuselah ; as the wise
LXXII interpreters have told us; as it is written in the
first [sacred] book of the Greeks.

The life also of Lamech, Noah's father, was five hundred and
fifty-three years ; and when he drew nigh unto death, he called
unto him his father Methuselah and his son Noah, and he wept
before his father Methuselah and said unto him, " Dismiss me,
O my father, and bless me."

Then Methuselah blessed his son Lamech, and said, "Not
one of all our fathers died before his father, but the father
[died] before his son, in order that there should be his son to
bury him in the earth. Now, however, my son, thou diest

10



146 TEE BOOK OF ADAM AND EVE. [book

before me, and I shall drink [the cup of] sorrow on thy account,
ere I go out of the flesh.

" Henceforth, my son, behold the world is changed, and
the [order] of deaths of men is changed : for from to-day the
son shall die before his father ; and the father shall not rejoice
in his son, nor be satisfied with him. So also shall the son not
be satisfied with his father, nor rejoice in him."

Then Lamech died, and they embalmed him, and laid him in
the Cave of Treasures. His death took place seven years before
the Flood came j and his father Methuselah and his son Noah
remained alone on the Holy Mountain.

But Noah went down every day to work at the ark, and
came up at eventide. And he instructed his sons and their
wives not to come down after him, and not to hold intercourse
with the children of Cain.

For Noah was anxious about his sons, and said in his mind,
" They are young and might be overcome by passion." So he
went down by night; and gave old Methuselah directions
about them.



CHAPTER IV.

But Noah preached repeatedly to the children of Cain,
saying, " The flood will come and destroy you, if we do not
repent.^' But they would not hearken to him; they only
laughed at him.^

When the children of Seth went down from the Holy Moun-
tain, and dwelt with the children of Cain, and defiled themselves
with their abominations, there were born unto them children
called Garsina,* who were giants, mighty men of valour, such as
no other giants were of equal might.^

Certain wise men of old wrote concerning them, and say in
their [sacred] books, that angels came down from heaven, and
* A corruption of the Ai-abic term.



III.] ABOUT THE RAGE OF GIANTS. 147

mingled with the daughters of Cain, who bare unto them these
giants.

But those [wise men] err in what they say. God forbid
such a thing, that angels who are spirits,* should be found
committing sin with human beings. Never ; that cannot be.'^

And if such a thing were of the nature of angels, or Satans,
that fell, they would not leave one woman on earth, undefiled.
For Satans are very wicked and infamous. Moreover, they are
not male and female by nature; but they are small, subtle
spirits, that have been black ever since they transgressed.

But many men say, that angels came down from heaven, and
joined themselves to women, and had children by them. This
cannot be true.f Bat they were children of Seth, who were of
the children of Adam, that dwelt on the mountain, high up [or
suspended], while they preserved their virginity, their inno-
cence and their glory like angels ; and were then called " angels
of God.'*

But when they transgressed and mingled with the children
of Cain, and begat children, ill-informed men said, that angels
had come down from heaven, and mingled with daughters of
men, who bare them giants.



CHAPTER V.

Then the ancient old man Methuselah who remained on the
mountain with Noah's sons, lived nine hundred and eighty-
seven years and then sickened; and his sickness was such that,
on account of it, he must depart [from this world] .

When Noah and his sons, Shem, Ham and Japhet, became
aware of it, they came to him with their wives, and wept before

him, and said, " our father, and [our] elder, bless us, and
pray God to have mercy on us when thou art gone from us/'

Then Methuselah said to them with a sorrowful heart, "Hear
me, my dear children ; for none of our fathers are left, but
you, eight souls.

" The Lord God created our father Adam and our mother
Eve, and from them filled the earth [with] people in the neigh-
bourhood of the garden, and multiplied their seed.

" But they have not kept His commandment, and He will
destroy them. But had they kept His commandment. He
would then have filled heaven and earth with them.

" Yet will I ask the Lord my God to bless you, to multiply
you, and to spread your race in a strange land, to which ye
shall go.

"And now, my children, behold, God will bring you inside
an ark unto a land to which ye have never been. And the
Lord God of all our pure fathers, be with you !

" And the glorious gifts God bestowed on our father Adam
from the garden in this blessed Cave of Treasures, may He
bestow them on you also !

"These are the three glorious gifts which God made to
Adam. The first is — kingdom wherein God made Adam king
over His works. The second glorious gift is — priesthood, in
that God breathed into his face a spirit of life. And the third
glorious gift is — prophecy, for Adam prophesied concerning
what God thought [of doing].

" But I will ask the Lord my God, to bestow those three
glorious gifts on your posterity."

Then Methuselah said also to Noah, " Noah, thou art
blessed of God. I warn thee and tell thee that I am going
from thee to [be with] all our fathers that have gone before
me.

" But thou, who shalt be left alone with thy children on this
holy mountain, keep the commandment I give thee, and forsake
not anything of what I have told thee.



III.] LAST WORDS OF METHUSELAH. 149

" Behold my God shall quickly bring a flood upon the earth ;
embalm my body, and lay it in the Cave of Treasures.

'* Then take thy wife with thy sons and their wives, and go
down from this holy mountain, and take with thee the body of
our father Adam j^ go into the ark and lay it there, until the
waters of the Flood are assuaged from off the face of the earth.
" my son, when about to die, command thy first-born
son Shem, to take Melchizedec,* son of Cainan, and grandson
of Arphaxad ;^ for that Melchizedec is priest of the Most High
God ;^'^ and to take with them the body of our father Adam
from within the ark, and remove it and lay it in the earth.

*' And Melchizedec shall stand ministering on that mountain
that is in the middle of the earth, before the body of our father
Adam for ever. For from that place, Noah my son, God
shall work salvation for Adam and for all of his seed that
believe in God."

Methuselah said also to Noah and to his sons, " The angel
of God will go with you, until you come to that place in the
middle of the earth."

Again Methuselah said to Noah, " my son, let him who
ministers unto God and before the body of our father Adam,
have a clothing of skin, and be girt about his loins with leather.
Let him wear no ornament, but let his raiment be poor ; let
him be alone,t and stand praying our Lord God to watch over
the body of our father Adam ; for it is a body of great value
before God.

" And let him continue in his ministry, he the priest of the
Most High God ; for he is well pleasing unto God, and so is
the ministry he fulfils before God."

After this Methuselah commanded Noah [saying], "Mind,
then, all these commandments, and keep them."

Then Methuselah's hands were loosened ; he ceased speak-

* The Arabic reads: "Melchizedec thy son's son," i.e., "Son of Shem," as
generally believed in the East,
j- i.e., single.



150 THE BOOK OF ADAM AND EVE. [book

ing ; he gradually closed his eyes, and entered into rest like
all his fathers ; his tears the time streaming down his cheeks,
and his heart grieving at being separated from them [all] ; bat
mostly because of that mountain of the garden, on which not
one of them was left ; for God was purposed to destroy all
creatures, and to blot them out from the face of the earth.

The rest of Methuselah took place when he was nine hundred
and sixty-seven years old, on the twelfth of Magabit on a Sunday.

Then Noah and his sons embalmed him, weeping and
sorrowing over him, and laid him in the Cave of Treasures.
And they wailed over him with a great wailing, they and their
wives, forty days. And when mourning and grief over Methu-
selah were ended, Noah and his sons began to do as Methuselah
had commanded them.



CHAPTER VI.

After his death, Noah, his sons, and their wives came to the
bodies of our fathers, worshipped them, and blessed themselves
in them, weeping and being in the deepest grief.

But Noah had finished the ark, and not one workman was
left in it. And he, with his sons, continued in prayer to God,
asking Him to show them the way of safety.

When Noah and his sons had ended their prayers, God said
unto him, " Go thou into the Cave of Treasures, thou and thy
sons, and take the body of our father Adam and lay it in the
ark J likewise take the gold, the incense, and the myrrh, and
lay them in the ark together with his body."

And Noah hearkened to God's voice, and went into the Cave
of Treasures, he and his sons ; they worshipped the bodies of
our fathers, and then Noah took the body of our father Adam,
and carried it in the strength of God, not requiring the help of
any one *^^

'*' Lit. and would (or wished) not that one should help him.



III.] ADAM'S BODY TAKEN TO THE AUK. 151

Then Shem his son, took the gold with him, and Ham
carried the myrrh, and Japhet carried the incense ; and they
brought them out of the Cave of Treasures, their tears the
while streaming down their cheeks.

But as they were bringing them out, the bodies among which
Adam had been laid, cried out, " Are we then to be separated
from thee, our father Adam t"

Then Adam's body answered, " Oh, that I must part from you
my sons, from this holy mountain ! Yet do I know, my sons,
that God will gather all our bodies together another time.

" But wait patiently until our Saviour have pity on us."

And the other bodies went on talking together, by the power
of God's Word.

Then Adam asked God that the divine fire might remain in
the lamp, before his sons, until the time when bodies shall rise
again.

And God left the divine fire by them, to shed light on them.
He then closed the cave upon them, and left not a trace to show
[where it is] until the day of the Resurrection, when He will
raise them up, like all other bodies.

But the discourse Adam held, and that too, he being dead,
was by the command of God, who would show His wonders
among the dead and the living.

After this let none of you say, that Adam's soul had already
been under Satan's judgment. It was not so ; but God com-
manded the souls of the dead, to come from under His hand ;
and to speak of the wonders of God from within their bodies."
Then they returned to their places until the day of the sure
deliverance that shall be unto them all.

CHAPTER VII.

But when Noah and his sons heard these voices from those
dead bodies, they wondered greatly, and their faith in God was
streuffthened.



152 THE BOOK OF ADAM AND EVE. [book

Then they went out of the cave and began to go down from
the Holy Mountain, weeping and wailing with a fervent heart,
for their being thus parted from the holy mountain, the abode
of their fathers.

And Noah and his sons went back and sought the cave, but
could not find it. Then they broke out into bitter lamentation
and deep sorrow ; for they saw that from that day forth, they
should have neither existence nor abode in it.

Then once more they raised their eyes and looked at the
garden and at the trees [that were] in it, and they lifted up
their voices in weeping and in loud crying, and said, *'We
salute thee in worship, garden of joy !^^ abode of brilliant
beings, a place for the righteous ! We salute thee, place
of joy that was the abode of our father Adam, the chief of
creation ; who, when he had transgressed, fell from thee ; and
then saw his body in life, naked and disgraced.

" And we, behold, we depart from the Holy Mountain to the
lower side of thee ; neither shall we dwell in it, nor yet behold
thee so long as we live. We wish God would remove theg with
us to the country to which we shall go ; but God would not
remove thee into a cursed land.

*' But God will take us, and will bring us into that land with
our children, until He has ended the punishment for our trans-
gression of His commandment."

Noah and his sons said also, " We salute thee, cave, abode
of the bodies of our holy fathers ; we salute thee, pure spot,
hidden from our eyes, yet fit to have those bodies laid within
thee ! The Lord God preserve thee, for the sake of the bodies
of our fathers !

Again they said, " We greet you, O our fathers, righteous
judges, and we ask you to pray for us before God, that He will
have pity on us, and deliver us out of this passing world.

" We ask you to pray for us — for us, the only ones left of
your seed ; We give you a greeting of peace !

" O Seth, great master, among the fathers, we greet thee



III.] NOAH LEAVES THE MOUNTAIN. 153

with peace ! O Holy Mountain abode of our fathers, we give
thee a greeting of peace ! "

Then Noah and his sons wept again, and said, " Alas, for us
eight souls that are left ! Behold we are taken away from the
sight of the garden."

And as they were coming down the mountain they greeted
the stones, took them in their hands and put them upon their
shoulders j they stroked down the trees, and did so weeping.
And they continued coming down from the mountain, until
they came to the door of the ark.

Then Noah and his sons turned their faces to the east, and
requested the Lord to have mercy on them, to save them, and
to command them where to lay the body of our father Adam.

Then the Word of God came to Noah, saying, " Lift up the
body of Adam to the third story [of the ark] , and lay it there
on the eastern side ; and the gold, the incense and the myrrh
together with him.'^

" And thou and thy sons shall stand before him praying.
But thy wife, and the wives of thy sons, shall be on the
western side of the ark ; and they and their wives shall not
come together."

Then when Noah heard these words from God, he and his
sons went into the ark, and laid the body of our father Adam
on the eastern side, and the three offerings together with him.

And Noah brought into the ark the body of Adam, on a
Friday, at the second hour, on the twenty-seventh of the
month of Gembot.



CHAPTER VIII.

Then God said unto Noah, " Go upon the top of the ark and
blow the trump three times, that all beasts gather together
unto the ark."



154 THE BOOK OF ADAM AND EVE. [book

But Noah said, " Shall the sound of the trump reach unto
the ends of the earth to gather together the boasts and the
birds?"

Then God said unto him, " It is not the sound of this trump
alone that shall go forth, but My power shall go with it, to make
it come into the ears of the beasts and of the birds.*

" And when thou blowest thy trump, 1 will command My
angel to blow the horn from heaven; and all these animals
shall be gathered unto thee."

Then Noah made haste and blew the trump, as God had told
him. Then the angel blew the horn from heaven, until the
earth quaked, and all creatures on it trembled.

Then all the beasts, birds and creeping things were gathered
together at the third hour, on a Friday ; when all the beasts,
lions and ostriches went into the lower story at the third hour.
Then at midday, came the birds and creeping things into the
middle story ; and Noah and his sons went into the third story,
at the ninth hour of the day.

And when Noah, with his wife, his sons and their wives
came into the upper story, he commanded the women to dwell
on the western side ; but Noah and his sons, with the body of
our father Adam, dwelt on the eastern side.



CHAPTER IX.

And Noah stood asking God to save him from the waters of
the Flood.

Then God talked to Noah, and said to him, " Of every kind
of birds, take one pair, male and female of the clean ; and of the
unclean also one pair, male and female. But also of the clean
take six [more] pairs, male and female."

* " All these beasts, birds, and creeping things, shall come to thee by the hand
of the angel who shall take and bring them to thee to keep them alive. Targ.
Jonathan, in Gen. vii.



III.] THE WATERS OF THE FLOOD. 155

And Noah did all this. Then when they all had got into
the ark, God shut to the door of the ark upon them by His
power.

He then commanded the windows of heaven to open wide,
and to pour down from them cataracts of water. And so it
was j by God's order.

And He commanded all fountains to burst open, and the
depths to pour forth water, upon the face of the earth. So
that the sea all round rose above the whole world, and surged,
and the deep waters arose.

But when the windows of heaven opened wide, all stores [of
water] and depths were opened, and all the stores* of the
winds, and the whirlwind, thick mist, gloom and darkness
spread abroad. The sun and moon and stars, withheld their
light. It was a day of terror, such as had never been.

Then the sea all round, began to raise its waves on high like
mountains ; and it covered the whole face of the earth.

But when the sons of Seth, who were fallen into wickedness
and adultery with the children of Cain, saw this, they then
knew that God was angry with them ; and that Noah had told
them the truth.

Then they all ran round the ark, to Noah, begging and
entreating him to open for them the door of the ark; inasmuch
as they could not climb the Holy Mountain, by reason of the
stones thereof, that were like fire.

But as to the ark, it was closed and sealed by the power of
God.^* An angel of God sat upon the ark, and was like a
captain to Noah, to his sons, and to all inside the ark.

And the waters of the flood increased on the children of
Cain and overwhelmed them ; and they began to sink, and the
words of Noah were fulfilled, which he preached to them
[saying], the waters of the Flood should come and drown
them.

And the waters continued above and below over Noah and

* Lit. locks.



156 THE BOOK OF ADAM AND EVE. [book

his sons, until they were suspended in the ark ; and by the
strength of the water, the ark rose from the earth ; and the
flesh of every moving thing perished.

And the water rose until it covered the earth, and until it
covered all high mountains ;^^ and the waters rose above them,
and above the tops of high mountains fifteen cubits, by the
cubit of the Holy Ghost, which is equal to* three cubits [of
man]. So that the number of these were forty- five cubits
[above the highest mountains] .

And the water increased and bare the ark, and brought it to
the lower side of the garden, which the waters, the rain, the
whirlwind and all that went about on the earth — did worship.
As did also Noah and his sons and all that was in the ark —
they bowed in worship to the holy garden.

And the water returned to its former state, and destroyed
every thing that was upon the earth and under heaven.

But the ark was floating on the waters and rose up before
the winds ; while the angel of God steered and led it from
east to west. And the ark thus moved about on the face of
the waters a hundred and fifty days.

After that, the ark stood upon the mountains of Ararat,^^ on
the twenty-seventh day of the month of Tkarnt.



CHAPTER X.

Then God sent again His order to Noah, saying, " Be
quiet and wait until the waters are assuaged.'*

Then the waters parted asunder and returned every water
to its own place, where it was at first ; the fountains ceased to
pour fortht over the earth ; the depths that are on the face of
the earth, ceased to rise ; and the windows of heaven were
closed. For floods of rain fell from heaven at the beginning
of the Flood forty days and foi*ty nights.

* Lit rendered by. f Or, spread.



III.] THE RAVEN AND THE DOVE. 157

But on the first day of the eleventh month the tops of high
mountains were seen ; and Noah waited yet forty days, and
then opened the window he had made on the western side of
the ark, and let go a raven, to see if the waters were assuaged
from the face of the earth or not,^^

Then the raven went forth, but returned no more to Noah ;
for the harmless dove is the sign of the mystery of the
Christian Church,

But Noah waited yet a little while after the waters were
assuaged, and then sent out a dove, to see if the water had
retired or not.

But when the dove went out, she found not a place whereon
to rest her foot, and no abode ; and she returned to Noah.

Then Noah waited seven days more, and sent out the dove
to see if the water had retired or not. And the dove came
back to Noah, about eventide ; and in her mouth was an olive-
leaf.*

The meaning of the dove is, that she is taken as a figure of
the old and of the new [covenants] .^^ The first time when she
went out, and found nowhere to rest her feet, that is, a place of
rest [is a figure of] the stiff-necked Jews, in whom no grace
remained, nor any mercy whatever. Wherefore Christ, the
meek one, who is figured in the dove, did not find among them
rest for the sole of His feet.

But the second time when the dove found a place of rest [is
a figure of] the nations that have received the glad tidings of
the holy Gospel, and among whom Christ has found a resting-
place.

CHAPTER XI.

In the six hundred and seventh year of Noah^s life, on the
second day of the month Barmudeh, the water dried from off

the earth.^^ And in the next month, which is Gembot, on the
twenty-seventh day thereof, which is the day on which Noah
went into the ark, on that self-same day did Noah also come
out of the ark, on a Sunday.

But when Noah, his wife, his sons aod their wives went out
of the ark, they again came together, and did not part asunder
one from another; at first, when they went into the ark, the
men and the women remained apart, Noah fearing lest they
should come together. But when the Flood was over, they
again came together, the husband with his wife.^

God also had sent great quietness over the beasts, the lions
that were in the ark, and over the birds and creeping things,
not to disagree among themselves.

Then Noah came out of the ark, and built an altar upon the
mountain. And he stood, and requested the Lord to show him
of what sacrifices he ought to take, and bring them unto Him
in offerings.

Then God sent His Word to Noah, saying, " Noah, take of
the clean kind, and offer of them upon the altar before me ;
and let the animals go out of the ark."

Then Noah went into the ark, and took of clean birds as
many as God had commanded him ; and offered them up in
offerings upon the altar before the Lord.*



CHAPTER XII.

Pattern of the covenant God made with Noah, when He showed
him, the bow on the cloud in heaven.

And God smelled the smell of Noah's offerings, and He made
a covenant with him, that the waters of the flood should not
again come upon the earth, henceforth and for ever.

* This was the altar built by Adam, on which he, Cain and Abel had oflFered
nacrifices. Targ. Jon<ithan, in Gen. viii. It was injured by the Flood ; but Noah
repaired it. Ibid.



III.] NOAH BUILDS A CITY. 159

And this is the covenant God made with Noah : —

God said unto Noah,*" I will make the bow of My covenant
come out in the cloud; and when it appears, then men shall
know that it is done in truth.

" And if I was wroth, when the bow was seen in the cloud,
then [it would show] that My anger and the punishment I
meant to bring upon men were over.

" Then, again, O Noah, I have made this bow of My covenant
to be seen in heaven, in order that all creatures should see it,
and think of the trials and afflictions that came upon them at
first, and repent, and turn from their evil ways.*'

And God accepted Noah's offering, and blessed him and his
sons, and said unto them, "Be fruitful and multiply, and
replenish the face of the earth.''

Then God commanded the earth to bring forth herb as it did
of old, for beasts, for birds, and for all that moves on the earth.

Then Noah worshipped before God, with his sons and their
wives J and they praised Him for the salvation He had wrought
for them.



CHAPTER XIII.

After this Noah took his sons, and built them a city and
called it Semanan ;^^ as they were eight souls that came out of
the ark.

And Noah and his sons dwelt on that mountain about a
hundred years, until he had children and children's children.

And Noah took a root of vine and planted it, and dressed it
nntU. it yielded fruit.^^ It was sweet, and Noah took some of
it, and pressed wine out of it, and took it one night and drank
of it, and was drunk.^^ And he came in to his wife unawares.

Then Ham, his son, came into the house in the morning
and saw his father uncovered, and drunk with wine, and with-
out sense to know anything.



160 THE BOOK OF ADAM AND EVE. [book

Then Ham his son kept on laughing at him, and said, " What
is this thou hast done, thou old man V*

But the old man understood not what he said; only Noah's
wife understood it well.

Then Ham went out laughing at his father, and told his
brothers Shem and Japhet what his father had done ; and
laughed at his parents.

But his brothers were angry with him, and rebuked bim well
for so doing ; because they were afraid of him, as regards the
old man ; for Ham was rough and hard in his talk.

Then Shem and Japhet rose quickly, and took with them a
coverlet, and put behind their backs that coverlet that reached
unto their feet ; and they walked backwards, and turned their
face towards the way they had gone, until they came to their
parents. Then they threw the coverlet over them, and went
from them in haste, so as not to see them.

But on the morrow after this, Noah's wife told him what
Ham had said and what he had done.

Then was Noah very angry with his son Ham* for what he
had done ; and he cursed him, and made him servant of his
brothers.

But Noah blessed Shem and Japhet, his sons, because they
had behaved well to him.

Then Noah married another wife, who bare him seven
cbildren. And he continued to dwell on that mountain until
the days drew near when he must depart [this life]. And
Noah lived three hundred and fifty years after he came out of
the ark.

Then he called his first-born son Shem, and conversed with
him, saying, " O my son, hearken unto what I command thee.**

''Behold [what] I command thee now [is], to hold good
until I die and ye bury me. Then, when ye have ended mourn-
ing for me, go into the ark in which we were saved from the
flood ; then bring out of it the body of our father Adam ; but
* See the Coran, sur. t, and Hotting., Hits*. Or., p. 35, sq.



m.] NOAH'S LAST WORDS TO SEEM. 161

let no one know of it but one that is of thy seed. Then make a
beautiful case for it, and lay it therein.

" Then take with thee some bread to be for provision unto
thee by the way, and wine whereof to drink on thy way ; for
the land to which thou shalt go is rough and hungry.

" Then take Melchizedec the youngest son of Cainan,*
thy son ; for God has chosen him from all generations of men, .
to stand before Him to worship and to minister unto Him, by
the body of our father Adam.^^

" Then lay the body of Adam in the midst of the earth ; and
set Melchizedec to stand by it ; and show him how to fulfil his
ministry before God."

Moreover Noah said unto Shem his son, " If ye will keep
my commandment and go [as I tell you], an angel of the Lord
will go with you, and show you the way, until ye come to the
place where ye shall lay the body [of Adam] in the midst of
the earth; for in that self -same place shall God work salvation
for the whole world.

" But, O my son, I know that our children forsook this good
commandment, and went down the Holy Mountain, and mingled
with the children of Cain, and that they perished with them in
the waters of the Flood.

" Know, O my son, that from Adam until this day, every
one of the ancients, gave commandments to one of the rest, at
the time of his resting from the flesh, and that they taught
[these commandments] anjong themselves.

" The first, O my son, who taught this commandment and
made it plain, was our father Adam ; he gave it to his son
Seth, who received it.

" Then Seth handed it to his son Enos who kept it. And
Enos gave it to his son Cainan who kept it. Then Cainan gave
it to his son Mahalaleel, who kept it, and handed it to his son
Jared.

" And Jared kept it and gave it to his son Enoch, who also
* Here the Arabic has Arphaxad, instead of Cainan see above, p. 149.

11



162 THE BOOK OF ADAM AND EVE. [book

kept this commandment and gave it to his son Methuselah,
who kept it, and gave it to his son Lamech who kept it, and
who gave it to me, his son ; and I have kept it.

''But my grandfather Methuselah also gave me a great
commandment which I have kept; and which I give thee
likewise. So, then, receive my commandment, and hold fast
my words ; and hide this mystery within thy heart ; but reveal
it not to one of all thy kindred. But go, and lay the body of
our father Adam in the earth 3 and let it remain there unto the
day of salvation."



CHAPTEE XIV.

But the ark was closed during the days of Noah ; neither
was any one allowed to touch it. Yet they went to it, blessed
themselves in it, and talked about it.

Noah, however, went into it every evening, to light the lamp
which he had made before our father Adam, and blessed himself
in that body.

And he did not neglect his office regarding the lamp, as it
was at first in the Cave of Treasures.

But as Noah knew that after him, the ark would not remain
whole, and that his children would part asunder and not return
to look after the body of our father Adam, and that wickedness
would increase in the earth and abominations among men,
therefore did he command his son SKem to hasten to take the
body of our father Adam,* and to remove it unto the middle
of the earth ; according to God's order.



CHAPTER XV.

Then when Noah had ended giving orders to his son Shem,
concerning the body of our father Adam, Noah said to his son
* See below, ch, xviii



III.] NOAH GIVES PORTIONS TO HIS SONS. 163

Shem, "Bring hither to me thy brothers, and make them
come near me."

Then when they came to Noah, he looked at them and said
unto them, " my sons, after my death ye shall part asunder,
and sore troubles shall happen to your race.

''But I will from now, divide among you the earth into
three portions ; as every one of you shall be settled in his own
portion.

" Unto Shorn my first-born son, shall his lot be from
Jerusalem which is a great city, as far as Qardayun and
Andika.* It takes in the border mountain that reaches unto
Gefur, between the land of Egypt and that of the Philistines.

" Unto my next son Ham, his portion shall be from Aris
towards the south, unto Fardundan and unto Gaduriun, and
unto the borders of the west.

''And unto my third son Japhet, his portion shall be from the
corner of the west towards the south unto Damatha, a large
tract of country ; and all the north also as far as Aris.''^^

He then said to them, " Let every one of you take a portion
different from that of his brothers ; and let every one of you
dwell in his own portion." And they settled in it, as he
commanded them.

And they all had sons and daughters during their father
Noah^s lifetime. And Noah divided the earth among them by
God*s order, in order that there should be no enmity between
the three brothers.

Then when Noah had ended his commandments to Shem and
to his brothers, his hands dropped, his tongue became dumb,
his eyes closed and he died, like his fathers. He died aged nine
hundred and fifty years,^'^ on a Wednesday, the second day of
the month Gembot, on the mountain on the which was the
ark ; and there he will remain until the day God reveals [his
resting-place] .

And they mourned for him forty days.f

CHAPTER XVI.

After they had ended mourning for Noah, an angel of God
appeared unto Cainan father of Melchizedec, and said unto him
in a vision, " Knowest thou me ?" And Cainan answered,
"No, my Lord."

Then the angel said to him, " I am the angel whom God has
sent unto thee, to give thee this commandment. And transgress
not the command of God."

When Cainan heard this from the angel of God, he wondered
and said unto him, " Speak, my Lord !"

And the angel of God said unto him, " I am the angel who
brought gold to thy father Adam, when he was below the
garden ; I am the angel who entreated God together with him,
when he offered his own blood upon the altar.

" I am Michael the angel who received the soul of Abel the
just ; I am the angel who was with Seth when he was born in
the cave.

" I am the angel who was with Enos and Cainan, and
Mahalaleel and Jared and Enoch, and Methuselah and Lamech,
and with Noah. But since he entered into rest, I stand by his
first-born son Shem.

'^ And, behold, God has sent me to thee, to take thy son
Melchizedec, and to remove him to the land, in which God
shall lay the body of our father Adam, and that he may be
high exalted before God. Let not thy heart be grieved at his
going away."

When Cainan heard these words from the angel, he wor-
shipped before him ; and said unto him, " The will of God be
done ! Behold, I and my son are in His hands. Let Him do
what He pleases."

This angel appeared unto Cainan, not on account of Cainan'a
righteousness and purity, but on account of Melchizedec, and of
his righteousness and purity.



III.] AN ANGEL APPEARS TO MELGHIZEDEG. 165

Then the angel said unto Cainan, " Commit not this mystery
to any one but to Shem alone."
And the angel departed from him.



CHAPTER XVII.

Then the angel of God came unto Melchizedec that night
while he was lying on his bed.

And he appeared unto him in the figure of a youth like him,
who smote him on the side, and awoke him out of his sleep.

When Melchizedec heard it, he rose up, and saw the house
full of light, and a figure standing before him. And he was
afraid, for he was not accustomed to see angels, but this once
only.

But the angel prevented fear from overcoming him, and
anointed him on the head and on the breast, and said unto him,
" Fear not, I am an angel of God ; and He has sent me to thee
with this message, that thou fulfil it unto thy God."

Melchizedec then said unto him, " What is that message ?"
For he was a youth of a perfect heart.

And the angel said unto him, " It is that thou go with the
body of our father Adam, unto the middle of the earth ; and
that thou stand ministering before it there ; and that thou
serve God ; for He has chosen thee from thy childhood. For
thou art of the seed of the blessed.''

Then Melchizedec said unto him, " Who will bring the body
of my father Adam, and me with it, unto the middle of the
earth ? "

And the angel said unto him, " Shem, the son of Noah thy
father's grandfather."

Then the angel strengthened his heart, and comforted him
tenderly one whole hour, and then said unto him, " Commit
not these hidden words to any but to Shorn only f^ lest the



166 TEE BOOK OF ADAM AND EVE. [book

report of it spread abroad ; and they hang on to the body of
Adam, and not let it go to the land, to which God has com-
manded [it to be taken] ."

And the angel departed from him.



CHAPTER XVIII.

Then the angel went to Shem the son of Noah and said unto
him, " Arise, and take the body of Adam, as thy father Noah
gave thee commandment ; and take with thee Melchizedec and
go with them to the place ordered by God ; and tarry not."

When it was day, Shem made a beautiful case and hid it
close to the ark. He then prepared bread and wine and
provisions, and came to Cainan; and inquired for his son
Melchizedec. Then Cainan began to tell him all that the
angel had said unto himj and he gave him up his son
Melchizedec, with a good heart.

Then Shem said to Cainan, " Keep this mystery secret, and
reveal it to no one.''

Then Shem took Melchizedec and they saddled an ass
between them, and they went to the ark. But they had no
key wherewith to open the ark ; for Noah had fastened it with
a padlock, after he had come out of it.

When, therefore, they came to the ark, they bethought
themselves how to open it. Then came Shem to the door, and
said to Melchizedec, '' Come, open it, thou great God."

Then came Melchizedec to the door when he heard [Shem's
voice] , and seized the padlock ; and at once the door was
opened.

But a voice cried from within the ark, and said, " Rejoice, O
thou priest of the Most High God, for that thou hast been found
meet to enter upon the office of priest of God ; the first created
by Him in the world."



iii.J SEEM AND MELGHIZEDEG DEPART. 167

This voice was from the Holy Ghost.

And Melchizedec knew that voice when it breathed into his
face ; he knew it also through great grace that was in him.

He then marvelled, and said to Shem, " my Lord, I know
by the breathing in my face, though I saw no form, and heard
no voice speaking to me; for I saw no one. This voice is
from the body of our father Adam/'

And Shem remained trembling, not knowing what to say to
him.

But while they were wondering at the door of the ark, the
Word of God came, that said, *' I am He that made thee priest
and that breathed of My Spirit into thee. Thou art My righteous
priest ; and thou art worthy to bear the body of Adam whom I
created, and into whom I breathed of My Spirit. And I made
him priest and a king, and a prophet. Go in first, and bring
out his body.''

Then Melchizedec went into the ark, and bowed in worship
to the body of our father Adam; he blessed himself in it,
and brought it out ; the angel Michael, helping him the while
to carry it.

And Shem went in also, and brought out the gold, the
incense and the myrrh, and laid them together with the body
of our father Adam ; he then placed the body within the case,
and shut it upon the body. And then he shut the door of the
ark, as it was at first.^^



CHAPTER XIX.

Then Shem and Melchizedec took the body of Adam, and
went on their way ; and the angel of God went with them and
showed them whither to go. And so they went on that day
until the evening ; and alighted at a certain place to rest.

Then Shem and Melchizedec stood up to pray; and while
they prayed there came a voice from inside the coffin of Adam,



168 THE BOOK OF ADAM AND EVE. [book

that said, " Glory to God who created me, who gave me life,
who made me die ; and who again returns me to the earth out
of which He took me !"

And the voice blessed the youth Melchizedec and said unto
him, " Of all our race, God chose no one but thee ; neither did
He anoint any one of them priest with His own hand, but thee ;
neither did He breathe into the face of any one His pure Spirit
as He breathed it into thee ; and I rejoice, my son, that thou
hast been found worthy of such honour from God.''

Then the voice withdrew from Melchizedec, who wondered
at this voice that came forth from a dead man. But it was
done by the power of God.

But when Shem saw this first wonder wrought on Melchize-
dec, he kissed his face, and rejoiced greatly on his account.
But as for Melchizedec, he tasted nothing that night, for the
joy that filled his heart ; but he continued standing before the
coffin of Adam, praising God and praying until morning. This
vision happened to Melchizedec in the fifteenth year of his age.

Then Shem and Melchizedec put the coffin upon the ass,
and went on their way ; and the angel of God went with them.
And it was so that when they came to rough places, the angel
bare them up by the power of God, and made them pass over
them, whether they were lands or mountains.

And so they went on their way until the evening of the
second day, when they alighted to rest, after their custom.

Then Shem and Melchizedec stood up to pray j and as they
were praying, behold a great light shone over them, wherefore
Melchizedec did' not feel* aught of fatigue, by reason of the
strength of God, that was in him ; but he rejoiced like one
that is going to his wedding.

But they stood praying as they were wont before the coffin
of our father Adam. Then came a voice from the top of the
coffin, that said to Melchizedec and to Shem, " Behold, we are
drawing near to the place our Lord has decreed for us."

* Lit. know.



III.] THEY GOME TO GOLGOTHA. 169

And the voice said unto Melchizedec, " Upon the land to
which we are going, shall the Word of God come down ; and
suffer and be crucified on the place in which my body is
laid.

" The crown of my head shall be baptized with His blood ;
and then shall my salvation be wrought ; and He shall restore
me to my kingdom, and shall give me my priesthood and my
gift of prophecy.'^

Then the voice was silent by the power of God.

But Melchizedec and Shem marvelled at the voice that
talked with them. And Melchizedec remained the whole of
that night praying joyfully until the day dawned. Then they
put the body of Adam on the ass, and went on their way.

And the augel of God went with them, until they neared the
place.

Then he went before them, and stood before the ass, and
took down from her the coffin, himself alone ; and not as on
the two former occasions, when Melchizedec took it down
[from the ass] .

But when the coffin reached the rock, the rock split asunder
into two parts, — that was the place for the coffin ; and
Melchizedec and Shem knew thereby that it was the place God
had appointed.

Then the angel went up from them into heaven, while saying
unto God, " Behold, the body of our father Adam has arrived*
and is come to the place Thou didst choose. I have done that
which Thou didst command me.^'

Then came the Word of God to the angel, saying, " Go down
to Melchizedec and strengthen his heart ; and command him
to abide by the body of Adam. And when Shem enters into
rest, tell Melchizedec to go, and to take from Shem the bread
and wine he has with him, and to preserve them."



170 TEE BOOK OF ADAM AND EVE. [book



CHAPTER XX.

Then the angel came down from God, in the figure of a man,
who appeared to Melchizedec and to Shem, and strengthened
their hearts.

He then laid the body of our father Adam in its place ; and
said to Melchizedec, '^Take from Shem the bread and the
wine.^' And he took them, as the angel told him [to do] .

But Melchizedec and Shem stood praying by the body of
our father Adam until the evening, when a great light came
down upon the body, and angels ascended and descended in
that place upon the body of our father Adam.

They were rejoicing, and praising, and saying, " Glory be
to Thee, O God, who didst create the worlds; and madest
men of the dust of the earth, to exalt them above heavenly
beings.'*

And the angels thus praised God over the body of our
father Adam, the whole of that night, until the dawn of
day.

But as the sun rose, the Word of God came to Melchizedec,
and said to him, ''Arise, and take twelve of these stones;
make of them an altar, and offer upon it of the bread and
wine that was with Shem ; and offer them, thou and he."

Then when Melchizedec heard the Word of God, he
worshipped between his hands ; and he hastened, and did
as God commanded him.

And at the time he was offering the gift upon the altar, and
asked God to sanctify it, the Holy Ghost came down upon
the offering ; and the mountain was filled with light.

And angels said unto him, " This offering is acceptable unto
God. Glory be to him who created earthly men, and has
revealed great mysteries unto them !"

Then the Word of God appeared to Melchizedec,^ and said



III.] SEEM PARTS FROM MELGHIZEDEG, 171

unto him, ''Behold, I have made thee priest; and thou and

Shem shall offer this offering thou didst make first; and in

like manner as thou didst set up^° these twelve solid foundation

stones, will I raise twelve apostles to be the pillars of the world.

And they are firm.

" In like manner also, as thou didst make this altar, will I

make thee an altar in the world ; and like as thou didst make

an offering of bread and wine, will I also present the offering

of My Body and Blood, and make it [to be] unto forgiveness

of sins.

" And this place on which thou art standing and in which

the body of Adam is laid, will I make a holy place; all

creatures on earth shall be blessed in it ; and in it I will grant

forgiveness unto all who come hither."

Then the Word of God, blessed Melchizedec — named him

priest — and then went up from him into heaven in glory and

rejoicing with His angels.



CHAPTER XXI.

Then Melchizedec praised God ; and he and Shem made an
offering. And Shem stayed with him that day, to rest from
the toil of the journey.

But when the day dawned, it seemed good to Shem to
depart. Then Melchizedec wished him God speed, and blessed
him, and said unto him, " The Lord God who led us to this
place, be with thee ; and guide thee until thou come to thine
own place. "^^

Melchizedec said also to him, " When they inquire of thee
about me, direct them not in the way ; that they come not to
me. And wheo my father and my mother ask thee about me,
say to them, ' He has departed [on a pilgrimage] ; and I do
not know the place of his pilgrimage.'



172 TEE BOOK OF ADAM AND EVE. [book

" So tliat, when ttou sayest so to them, their hope of me will
be cut short ; and they will feel it is of no use thinking of me ;
so that they will not press thee, and make thee come to me."

Shem, then departed, and returned to his kindred ;^' while
Melchizedec remained standing before the body of our father
Adam, ministering unto God, and worshipping Him evermore.

And an angel abode with him, who protected him and
brought him food, until the time of Abraham the patriarch.

And the raiment of this Melchizedec was of skins, with
a leathern girdle around his loins. And he ministered unto
God, with much praying and fasting.



CHAPTER XXII.

But Shem and his brothers, multiplied abundantly upon the
earth ; and begat sons and daughters ; and went on this way,
until Shem was five hundred and fifty years old, when he
died.^^

Then they embalmed him, and continued mourning for him
forty days.

After this, Arphaxad, son of Shem, lived four hundred and
eighty-five years, and then died ; and they embalmed him and
mourned for him forty days.

Then after him was Cainan, son of Arphaxad and father of
Melchizedec, who lived five hundred and eighty-nine years, and
then died.3*

After him Saleh, son of Cainan, and brother of Melchizedec
lived four hundred and eight years, and then died.

After him Eber* his son, lived four hundred and thirty-four
years, and then died.

Then Phalek was bom when his father was two hundred
and seven years old. In the days of Phalek, the earth was
divided a second time among the three sons of Noah, Shem,
Ham, and Japhet.
♦ Ebcr took to wife Azurad Nebrud's [Nimrud's] daughter. Kufale,c. viii, p. 34.



III.] THE DIVISION OF TONGUES. 173

Wherefore were they much aggrieved through this division
among themselves ; because during their father's life-time, they
were gathered together. But now they were divided asunder,
and much affliction befell them on that account.

But Phalek died, and they buried him in his own city
Phalek. For they had built a city, and had called it after his
name.

But after his death, which happened when he was four
hundred and thirty years old, there were great disturbances,
and men gathered together within fenced cities.

And after this, tongues (there are seventy -two) were divided;
for God divided them when men built the tower in Sennaar ;^^*
but it was destroyed over them.^^ And God divided their
languages j and what remained of them He dispersed over
the earth ; because they built without a fixed plan. Therefore
God dispersed them and scattered them, and brought upon
them the division of their languages ; until if one of them
spake, no other understood what he said.^^ And the number of
languages is seventy-two.

And when they were thus divided, they had over them
seventy-two rulers, one to every tongue, and to every country,
by way of a king. And of the seed of Japhet were six peoples.

CHAPTER XXIII.

Then Ragu, Phalek's son, lived two hundred and thirty-two
years, and died. But when Ragu, Phalek's first-bom son, was
one hundred and thirty years old, there reigned one of the
first kings that ever reigned on the earth, whose name was
Nimrud, a giant.

That Nimrud saw a cloud of light under heaven ; a mere
apparition of Satan. And he inclined his heart to it, and
coveted its beauty ; and then called to one whose name was

174 THE BOOK OF ADAM AND EVE. [book

Santal, a carver, and said to him, " Carve me a crown of gold,
after the pattern of that cloud/'^^

Then Santal made him a crown [of gold] which Nimmd
took and placed upon his own head. Wherefore was it said
that a cloud had come [down] from heaven, and overshadowed
him. And he became so wicked, as to think within himself
that he was God.

And in those days Ragu was one hundred and eighty years
old, and in his one hundred and fortieth year, Yanuf* reigned
over the land of Egypt.

He is the first king that reigned over it; and he built the
city of Memphis, and named it after his own name. That is
Misr ; whose name is rendered Masrin.

This Yanuf died ; and in his stead, in the days of Ragu, one
from the land of India reigned, whose name was Sasen ; and
who built the city of Saba. And all the kings who reigned
over that country were called Sabaeans, after the name of the
city.

And it was so, until the days of Solomon, son of David.

Then again Phar'an reigned over the children of Saphir, and
built the city of Saphirf with stones of gold ; and that is the
landj of Sar'ania, and because of these stones of gold, they
say that the mountains of that country and the stones thereof
are all of gold.

Then the children of Lebensa of the country of India, made
king over them, one named Bahlul, who built the city of Bahlu.

Then Ragu died in his two hundred and eighty-ninth
year.

of stone, were openly worshipped in the world. The children

III.] INCREASE OF IDOLATRY. 175

of men began to make idols of stone, the first of which, were
Kahthon and Helodon.

And the children of men multiplied upon the earth, and their
wickedness increased also ; for they had neither law nor order ;
and no teachers to guide them in the way of righteousness ;
nor any one to be judge among them.

Wherefore they grew worse and worse, and wandered farther
from the way of God; every one of them did what he himself
listed ; and they made for themselves idol-gods, which they
worshipped.

They had no hope in the resurrection of the dead. But
whenever one of them died, they buried him, and set up an
idol over his grave; and said, that was his god, that would
show him mercy in his grave. They said also, as regards the
dead, that when his god was set up over his grave, the
remembrance of him, would not be cut off from the face of the
earth.

This was a common saying brought out by Satan ; and the
earth was thus filled with idols ; and those idols were of divers
kinds, men and women.

After this Serok died two hundred and thirty years old ; and
they embalmed him in Sar'ania his city, that was built in his
name.

After that Nahor, when twenty -nine years old begat Terah.
And when Nahor was eighty-six years of age, God looked
down upon the children of men, [and saw] that they were
ruined and worshipped idols.

Then God sent forth winds, and the whirlwind, and earth-
quakes on the earth, until the idols were broken one against
another. Yet the children of men did not repent of their sins,
neither did they turn to God from their iniquities that He
might save them ; but rather increased in wickedness.

And in the twentieth year of Terah's life, the worship of
idols spread over the earth in the city of Aarat, which Barwin,
the son of Eber, had built.



176 THE BOOK OF ADAM AND EYE. [book

And at that time there was a rich man living in it, who
died ; and his son made an idol of gold in the likeness of his
father, and set it up on his [father's] grave.

He then ordered one of his servants, to stand by the idol,
and to minister unto it ; to sweep the ground around it, to pour
water to it and to burn incense.

But when Satan saw this he entered into the idol of gold,
and talked to the servant, like his master's father that was
dead ; and said to him, " Thou doest well thus,"

After this a thief took by surprise the house of the youth,
son of the man who was dead ; who then came to his father's
grave, weeping.

And he said, " my father, they have carried away all my
goods."

Then Satan answered him from within the idol, and said,
" Do not stay here, but go and bring thy son, and offer him
up in oblation to me, and then I will return to thee all thy
goods."

Then that youth went, and did with his son, as Satan had
commanded him. And at that time Satan entered into him,
and taught him to practise enchantments, and magic, .the
mixture of drugs, and divination.

That was the first evil example [of the kind] set to men, to
take their children and to offer them up in oblation to idols
and to devils.



CHAPTER XXV.

Then in the hundredth year of Nahor, God looked down
upon the children of men [and saw] that they sacrificed their
children to idols.

Then God commanded the stores of winds to open, and to
send forth the whirlwind, and gales, and darkness upon the
whole face of the earth, until all the idols and images, and

figures wero brought together [by the winds] in mountains
upon mountains high. " And the idols remained buried under
them until this day.*^

Many wise men have written about this wind, that it was
the wind of the Flood ; and many of them say it was the water
of the Flood that thus brought together these mountains [of
idols] .

But they erred, and said what is false concerning it ; because
ere the water of the Flood came upon the earth, there were no
idols in it. But the Flood came upon the men at that time
because of their adulteries, and of the sins which they com-
mitted among themselves ; both the children of Cain, and
those who followed them.

Moreover at that time the whole earth was not filled with
people ; but only the land of the garden, in which dwelt the
children of Seth ; and the place inhabited by the children of
Cain ; besides that, the whole earth was bare [of inhabitants] .

But when the Flood came, it bare the ark, and brought it
to this land of trouble. And this earth was filled with people ;
and that land was laid waste.

Then in those days, king Nimrud saw a flaming fire in
the east, which arose from the earth.*

Then said Nimrud, *' What is that fire l"f He then went
towards it ; and when he saw it, he bowed to it in worship,
and appointed a priest to minister before it, to burn incense
to it, and to sacrifice victims to it. From that day the
men of Fars began to fill the earth.

Then Satan the worker of idols saw a fountain of water
near the fire-pit, and he came to it, and looked at it, and made
a horse of gold, and set it up on the edge of the fountain of
water j and it so happened that all those who came to wash in
that fountain of water, bowed in worship to that golden horse j

and from that time, the people of Fars began to worship
horses.

But the priest* whom Nimrud appointed to minister to the
fire and to bum incense to it, wished to be a teacher, and wise
of the same wisdom as Nimrud, whom Barwin, Noah's fourth
son had taught.

That priest, therefore, kept on asking Satan, while standing
before the fire, to teach him this evil ministry and abominable
wisdom. So, when Satan saw him doing his best in the
service [of the fire], he talked to him, and said, "No man can
become a teacher, or wise, or great before me, unless he
hearkens to me, and goes and weds his mother, his sister and
his daughter.''

Then that priest hearkened to Satan in all that he com-
manded him, and taught him all manner of wisdom and of
wickednesses. And from that time, the people of Fars have
committed like sins unto this day.

And Nimrud built great cities in the east; and wrought
all manner of iniquities in them.*^

* That priest was called Arde8hau. Nazam al-j., p. 65.



IV.] BIRTH OF ABRAHAM, 179



1300K IV.



CHAPTER I.

Then when Terah was two hundred and thirty years old, he
fell sick, and called Abraham' his son,^ and said unto him,
" my son, I wish to die."

But Abraham stood up and comforted him, paid him all due
honour, and did not aggrieve him about his being a maker of
idols.

For Abraham his son, was a righteous man, and could not
bear idols ;^ but he paid him all due respect, as being his
father.

Then Terah died ; and Abraham and Nahor buried him in a
mountain.

But when Abraham was grown up, God said unto him, "
Abraham, come out of thy land, of thy kindred and of thy
father's house, and go to the land that I will show thee."

Then Abraham arose, and took Sarah his wife, and Lot his
brother's son,* and they came to the land of the Amorites.*
And Abraham was seventy years old when he saw this vision ;
and this was his first wandering from the land of the east, to
the western side of the river Euphrates.

So Abraham came, and dwelt among kings; and those
kings rose up against his brother's son, and carried him away

* Lot was the son of Haran, Abraham's brother, who perished in trying to put
out the fire set by Abraham to the idol temple at Ur. Abul-pharaj., Dyiv. Arab,

180 THE BOOK OF ADAM AND EVE. [book

captive.* Then Abraham took his servants, and all those who
were about him, and came to his brother's son, and delivered
him out of their hands.

At that time Abraham was eighty years old, and no son was
born to him, because that Sarah his wife, was barren.

Then as he was returning from the war with those kings,
the grace of God drew him, until he had passed over the hill of
Nablus j and from the hill of Nablus, he came near to Jerusalem,
ere it was built.f

Then Melchizedec, priest of the Most High God, came out,
and welcomed him with joy. And Abraham, when he saw
Melchizedec, made haste and bowed to him in worship, and
kissed him on the face ; and M^elchizedec gave him a good
blessing.^

Then Abraham gave Melchizedec a tenth of all he had with
him. J After that Abraham communed with Melchizedec of
the holy mysteries which Melchizedec had consecrated with
his own hand. For that was an exalted place, not by man's
hand, but God Himself had anointed it.

But after Abraham had communed with Melchizedec, God
said unto Abraham, " Fear not, great is thy reward with Me ;
and in like manner as Melchizedec My high priest blessed
thee, and made thee partaker with himself of Holy Mysteries,
so will I make thee partaker with him of heavenly grace."

Again did God say to Abraham, " In blessing will I bless
thee, and in multiplying will I multiply thy seed upon the face
of the earth."

* Og, King of Bashan, who had been saved by sitting on the top of Noah's ark,
and who was among those kings, came and told Abraham that they had taken Lot
captive. Targ. Jonathan, in Gen. xiv.

t The Kufale dwells at great length on the history of Abraham, borrowed
chiefly from the Scripture account. But whether by accident or otherwise, it
makes no mention of Melchizedec, but only of priests and of tithe, as an institution
of God for ever.

X Eutych., Nazamal-j., p. 66.



IV.] ABBAnAM IN EGYPT. 181



CHAPTER IT.

After this there was a famine in the land of Palestine ; and
Abraham went down into the land of Egypt.

And Sarah his wife was with him, and she was good-looking.

So Abraham said to her, " Say not, I am Abraham's wife,
lest they kill me, and take thee from me. But say, I am his
sister.^'

Then when they came into the land of Egypt,^ men spake to
Pharaoh king of Egypt, and said to him, " Behold a man has
come hither ; and with him is his beautiful sister."

Then Pharaoh sent and took her from Abraham, who
remained weeping.

But God in His mercy sent an angel who smote Pharaoh,
and said to him, " Send back to Abraham his wife, lest God
kill thee."

Then in the morning, Pharaoh called Abraham, and said
unto him, " Forgive me." He then gave him his wife Sarah ;
and gave to Sarah, Hagar the Egyptian, and gave her many
presents.

After this Abraham took Sarah his wife, with Hagar her
maid-servant, and returned to Palestine.

And after that, Abraham took to himself Hagar to wife,*
who bare him Ishmael, when Abraham was eighty-seven years
old.

But in that Abraham said, " Sarah is my sister," he did not
lie ; inasmuch as Terah, his father, married two wives ; one of
which was called Tona,t the mother of Abraham, who died
shortly after he was born.

Then Terah married again another wife whose name was
Tahdif,J who bare him Sarah, whom Abraham married, and

* She was the daughter of Pharaoh, son of Nimrud who had cast Abram into
the fiery furnace. Targ. Jonathan, in Gen. xvi.

t Called Yuna, Eutych., Nazam al-j., p. 65. X Called Tohwait, Eutych., ibid.



182 THE BOOK OF ADAM AND EVE. [book

who, for that reason, said, " She is my sister " — on my father's
side, but not on my mother's.

After this, when Abraham was dwelling in tents, the Lord
came to him with angels of His, and gave him a sign of the
birth of his son Isaac,'' who was born to him when he was a
hundred years old. The Lord showed him also many mysteries.

Then days after this, God said to Abraham, when Isaac was
fourteen years old, *' Offer unto me thy son Isaac, in oblation."^

Then Abraham fortified himself and took courage for this
trial ; and brought his son to offer him in oblation to God.*
But God redeemed Isaac with a lamb that was tied to a bush.

And the bush to which the lamb was tied, is the very place
into which the tree of the Cross was planted. And the lamb
that saved Isaac from death, was a figure of the Lamb of God
who saved us all from death.

That mountain also, on which king David saw an angel
standing with a sharp sword of fire in his hand, as if going to
smite Jerusalem with it — is the place where Abraham saw with
the eye of the Holy Ghost, the Son of God, hanging on it.

For this reason did the Lord say to the Jews, '' Abraham,
your father, rejoiced and longed to see my day, and he did see
it, and was glad."

Again, this is the place, as the blessed Paul said, " For the
sake of Jesus Christ my Lord am I minister of the circum-
cision " — where Christ was circumcised on the eighth day.*

That is also the place where the patriarch Abraham offered
np an oblation to God.

And again, as it was in the days of Moses, when they offered
up a lamb for the sins of the people, to cleanse them from
their sins — so also did the Lamb of God offer up Himself in
oblation for us, to set us free from our sins.



* The translator or writer of the book evidently thought Christ was circumcised
in the Temple. This clause seems ill-joined with the rest.



IV.] MELCHIZEDEO AT JERUSALEM. 183

CHAPTER III.

After ttis Melchizedec showed himself to men, who saw him,
and who were comforted by his words, everywhere.

The kings of the earth and peoples, when they heard his
voice, did gather together; a multitude of creatures and of
kings ;* that numbered twelve hosts.

They came to him and bowed to him in worship, and were
blessed by him, and asked him, saying, " Come, let us make
thee king over us.''

But Melchizedec king of Salem, and priest of the Most High
God, would not.

And the kings wondered at his beauty; their hearts were
drawn to him by his discourse, and they fell down at his feet
in worship ; and they asked God, that Melchizedec might
dwell among them in their palaces.

But Melchizedec would not, and said unto them, " I cannot
leave this place, and go to another one.''

So those kings said among themselves, " Let every one of
us who can, come, and let us build a city on this mountain for
Melchizedec."

They all took pleasure in the work, brought together
materials in abundance, and built the City of Jerusalem,
that means " the middle of the earth."

Then Melchizedec continued to dwell in it, at that place;
and the kings came, and were blessed by him, until the day of
his departure, when his life ended in this world.

CHAPTER IV.

After this, Abraham ordered one of his servants, f to take a

wife for his son Isaac ; and adjured him not to marry Isaac,
but to one of his own kindred.

And Abraham entered into rest when one hundred and
seventy-five years old ; and Isaac and Ishmael his sons buried
him.^»

Then Isaac married when he was forty years old ; and Esau
and Jacob his sons, were bom unto him when he was about
sixty years of age.* And God blessed Isaac greatly.

Then after this Jacob went to the land of Haran, to Laban,
his mother's brother, and married his two daughters Leah and
Eachel.

He had by Leah, Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar,
^nd Zebulun ; and by Rachel he had Joseph and Benjamin.

Then he had also by Zilpah, Leah's maid-servant. Gad and
Aser ; and by Bilhah, Rachel's maid-servant, he had Dan and
Naphtali.

And about twenty years after Jacob's return from the land
of Haran, before his father Isaac died, Joseph was sold by his
brothers, because they were jealous of him.

But when Isaac died, his two sons Esau and Jacob came to
him, embalmed him, and laid him in the sepulchre of his
father.

Then six years after the death of Isaac, Rebecca died ; and
they buried her by Sarah, Abraham's wife. And when, after
that Leah, Jacob's wife died, they buried her by the side of
them.

Then after this Judah took to himself a wife whose name
was Habwadiya, that means, " house- wife j"t but in the law
her name is Sewa.

She was of a Canaanitish family, and Jacob's heart suffered

elder should serve the younger. Eutych., Nazam al-j., p. 77.

•f And in the Arabic original it is rendered, "Sahaniyeh," that means a black
linen girdle.



IV.] JACOB DIES IN EGYPT. 185

much on that account ; and he said to Judah his son who had
married that wife, " The God of Abraham and of Isaac will
not allow the seed of this Canaanitish woman to mingle with
my seed/'

But some days after this, Sewa bare three sons unto Judah,
whose names were Er, Onan, and Selah. And when Er was
grown up, Judah married him, his first-born son, unto a woman
named Tamar, daughter of Kadesh Levi.

And Er continued with her a long time, and behaved after
the manner of the men of Sodom and Gomorrah. But God
looked down upon his evil deeds and killed him.

Then Judah married his son Onan to Tamar, saying, " He
shall raise seed unto his brother."

But him also did God kill because of his evil deeds ; on
account of Jacob's curse, " That no Canaanitish seed should
mingle with his own." So God would not let any of it mingle
with that of Jacob the righteous.

Therefore did Tamar go to Judah her father-in-law, who had
intercourse with her, not knowing she was his son's wife; and
she bare unto him twins, Pharez and Zarah.



CHAPTER V.

After this Jacob went to Joseph, and continued fourteen
years in the land of Egypt, where he died at the age of one
hundred and fifty-seven; when the good Joseph was fifty-
three years old.

Then when he was dead, Joseph called cunning Egyptian
embalmers, who embalmed him beautifully ; and then Joseph
carried his body to the land of Canaan, and buried him in the
sepulchre of his fathers Abraham and Isaac.

After this Pharez begat Judah, and Judah begat Ezrom,
and Ezrom begat Aram ; and Aram begat Aminadab ; and
Aminadab bcjxat Naasson.



186 THE BOOK OF ADAM AND EVE. [book

And this Naasson was great among the sons of Judah ; and
the daughter of Aminadab married Eleazar the son of Aaron,
who prayed to God, until His wrath abated.

Thus, my son, have I told thee in detail the genealogies
from the first until now.



CHAPTER VI.

After this, there began to issue a race from Naasson, who
was great among the sons of Judah; and from him began
a kingdom and a priesthood, and the Jews became celebrated
through him.

Then Naasson begat Salmon, and Salmon begat Boaz of
Rahab. And thou must know that from Boaz and Ruth the
Moabitess, began the kingdom whereby Lot, the son of
Abraham's brother, obtained a share [in the generations] of
the kingdom [of Judah].

For God denied not seed to Lot, neither would He cut it
short. For this Lot was righteous, and shared all Abraham's
troubles with him ; and received the angels of God in Sodom
and Gomorrah.

Therefore did God give to Lot's children fellowship in the
kingdom, and that was [reckoned] for righteousness unto Lot
the righteous. For this reason also were [Lot's children]
mentioned among the genealogies of the kingdom of Abraham
and of Lot ; for Christ was born of their seed.

Then, again, Obed, Ruth's son, was of Lot's seed, on his
mother's [side] ; and Obed begat Jesse ; and Jesse begat
David the king. And king David begat Solomon ; all these
are of Ruth the Moabitess.

Again, Amnan,* the daughter of [Dan] , king of the Ammo-
nites, was of Lot's seed ; and Solomon the king took this

* Naamah. 1 Kg., xiv, 21, 31.



IV.] BIRTH OF MOSES. 187

daughter of Dan to wifoj and had by her, Eehoboam, who
reigned after Solomon.

But king Solomon took to himself many wives, seven
hundred daughters of kings, three hundred concubines, one
thousand in number.

But although Solomon took to himself these many wives,
they did not bare him a single male child, but Rehoboam, of
Amnan, the daughter of Dan, king of Ammon ; who was of
a blessed race.

Thus, again, God would not allow the seed of Canaanites to
mingle with that of strange peoples, which God had made
strangers. And this shows that Christ came of the seed of
Abraham the blessed father, and of Lot his brother's son.

And all the families of the children of Israel in the land of
Egypt, were Levi, Amram, Moses, Joshua, and Caleb, son of
Jephunneh ; all these were great chiefs over their peoples.



CHAPTER YII.

As to Moses, when they had thrown him into the river,
Sephurah, the daughter of Pharaoh, took him up thence, and
brought him up. She it is, whom the Hebrews call Mariam, the
mother of Moses.

And Moses abode forty years in Pharaoh's house ; and other
forty years in the land of Midian, ere God spake to him.

Then, again, when God spake to Moses from within the bush
his tongue faltered ; and [his] tongue was — as God said, " From
the time that I spake to My servant Moses, he was of a faltering
tongue.''

And Moses dwelt forty years in the land of Egypt, and forty
years in the land of Midian, with the priest Jethro, his father-
in-law ; then forty years more in the wilderness ; when Moses
died, aged one hundred and twenty years.

Then after him arose Joshua, the ton of Nun. He was



188 THE BOOK OF ADAM AND EVE. [book

twenty-seven years judge over the children of Israel, and
exorcised judgment over them ; he was prophet among them,
and kept them, and led them in the right way j and he entered
into rest and died, when sixty years old.

Then after him arose Kusarat the judge, eight years, and he
died ; and after him Phutamiral, the son of Kaba, judged the
children of Israel forty years, and died.

After him Naod, son of Phuru, judged the children of Israel
eighty years. But in the twenty-fifth year of Naod, ended
four thousand years since Adam. Naod died, and Sikar judged
the children of Israel. But in his days a king of Canaan rose
against Sikar, wishing to make war against him. But God
gave Sikar victory over him, whom he defeated; and Sikar
judged forty years.

After him Yarod was judge over the people of Israel, forty
years ; and after him Abimelec judged ten years, and died.

And after him Banu, son of Yuorani, judged twenty-three
years, and died. After him Yar of Phila, judged twenty-two
years, and died.

After him the son of Aminadab, judged fifty-eight years, and
died. And after him the daughter of Nasyamu judged seven
years, and died.

After her, Ansyus judged seven years, and died ; and after
him the Philistine judged forty years. But God gave him
into the hands of the champion Samson, who slew him.
Then the champion Samson arose and was judge over the
children of Israel twenty years, and then died.

Then the children of Israel were left without a judge twelve
years, when Eli the priest began to judge ; and judged them
forty years, and then died.

After him Samuel was judge over the children of Israel forty
years, and. died. Then after him, Saul reigned over them forty
years, and died.

Then after him, David reigned over the children of Israel
forty years, and then died. And after him, his son Solomon



IV.] REIQN OF SOLOMON. 189

arose, who also reigned forty years over the children of Israel,
and then died.

He wrought more wonders in the earth than all other kings,
who were before him. For he was the first whom God filled
with wisdom. So that he made [and did] many things peculiar
to him ; so far as to make a ship, and go in it to the city of
Saphir; [where] he wrought gold in ornaments, and brought
it to Jerusalem.

During his reign, there was great peace ; there was no
trouble ; but there was peace between him and Hiram king of
Tyre ; who reigned five hundred years over the city of Tyre,
and whose kingdom lasted from the reign of Solomon, to that
of Zedekiah ; until, from the length of his days and of his
years, and from the greatness of his kingdom, he exalted
himself and said, " I am God, and no man."'^

God was wroth against him because of his evil deed ; and
God looked down upon it, and delivered him into the hands of
king Nebuchadnezzar who put him to death ; removed his army,
and took his spoil.



CHAPTER VIII.

But we will inform thee of the things king Solomon'^ gave
every day in his house. On account of his many wives, they
made bread in his house of thirty cores of fine flour ; one
hundred cores of wheat flour, which hardly sufiiced. And they
slaughtered in his house daily, ten bullocks well-fatted, and
twenty fat oxen, and one hundred sheep ; besides what they
slew of bufialoes, gazelles and wild deer, which they hunted
every day. And in Solomon's house they drank daily four
hundred basins of wine. And many other things did they.

And Solomon reigned over his large kingdom with the
greatest wisdom ever found. But he did not keep his soul ;
but inclined his heart to the love of women, and forsook God



190 THE BOOK OF ADAM AND EVE. [book

who had created him, and who had given him this kingdom.
And he died in his denial of Him, and iu his sins.

After him reigned Rehoboam, his son, seventeen years, and
did evil. He defiled Jerusalem with abominable sacrifices,
and sacrificed to Satan ; and adultery increased greatly in his
days. Wherefore God cut off his kingdom swiftly ; and took
it from the house of David.

But in the fifth year of Rehoboam, a king whose name was
Susakim came up against Jerusalem. He took all the spoil of
the temple, and spoiled all Roboam had, and spoiled all the
house of David, and removed them and took them to his own
country.

And he boasted, and said to the Jews, " The things I have
taken from you as spoil, are goods that belonged to my fathers,
of which your fathers spoiled them, when they came out of the
land of Egypt, and which they brought unto this place ; and
behold, I have taken them from you."

And Rehoboam died in his denial [of God] ; and after him, his
son Abius, reigned twenty years over the children of Israel.
But he, too, walked in his father's ways, by reason of Makia
his mother, the daughter of Absalom ; wherefore, did he many
wicked things, and then died.

After him arose Asaph his son, who reigned forty-one years
over the children of Israel. He did what was right, just and
good before God ; he brake down the idols that were in his
day, and removed their images from the face of the land ;
and he took his wicked mother Anna, and threw her down
from the roof [of her house] and she died, because of her
adulteries.

After that, came Eleazar a black king, who was king of
Endena, to fight Asaph. But God delivered him into the hands
of Asaph, who defeated him.

Then Asaph died ; and his son Jehoshaphat reigned in his
stead. He also did that which is just and good before God, and
pleased God all his days, and then died.



IV.] KINGS OF JUDAH AND OF ISRAEL. 191

Then his son Aram reigned in his stead ; but he transgressed
the commandments of God, and forsook His law, and sacrificed
unto idols.

Then Zambri rose up against him, made war against him,
and he died in his denial [of God] .

Then Yusia, his son, reigned [after him] ; but on account
of his transgressions, God delivered him into the hands of his
enemies, who put him to death. But when he was dead, his
mother rose up against all the royal children and put them to
death, and said, " I will take the kingdom from the house of
David."

Then Yusabet daughter of the king of Aram, arose, took
Agragarina, and slew him before the eyes of the royal children
that were left. But when she had put him to death, she feared,
and hid herself and those with her, under a bed. And Gotholia
was queen over the children of Israel, and died.

Then the whole people of Israel said, " Whom shall we make
king over us V

Then when Yuda the high priest heard they spake thus, he
gathered together the whole of the Jews within the Temple,
and waited until the messengers of thousands and the
messengers of hundreds came ; and then Yuda the high priest,
said to them, " What do you require of me, and who is he
whom ye will make king over the house of David ?"

Then they said to him, " Thou hast authority."

Then Yuda rose and took Barsia, and brought him before
them, and said to them, " Does this one suit you for a king V

The people were pleased with him ; so Yuda brought him
into the house of God, and set him over the kingdom ; then
all the people rejoiced, and the whole country was quiet in
his days ; and he was king in Jerusalem forty years.

But Barsia did not bear in mind all the good things Yuda
the priest had told him; but he took him and put him to
death. After this, enemies rose up against Barsia and put
him also to death.



192 THE BOOK OF ADAM AND EVE. [book

CHAPTER IX.

After him his son Araazias reigned twenty-nine years, and
put to death those who had killed his father; but he did not
put to death their children, so as to fulfil the law of Moses,
that says, " Ye shall not put to death children for the sins of
their fathers."

Then Amazias died, and after him Ozia reigned fifty-two
years, and in his reign exercised justice and judgment, and
right before God. Yet did he do one wicked act, and that
was that — without due orders,* he offered sacrifices unto God,
and oblations that did not become hira. So he died.

After him Yonathan his son, reigned sixteen years. But
during his reign, he did eyil before God, and angered his
Creator, and forsook His commandment and His law ; and
burnt incense to idols, and sacrificed unto them. For this reason
did God deliver him to death, into the hands of Caran, king
of Elmosal.f

And when the king of Elmosal led him away [captive] , he
[Yonathan] took all the vessels he found in the house of God,
and sent them all to the great king of Elmosal ; and left nothing
in the house of God.

In the days of this king, did the children of Israel, go the
first time into captivity. He removed them to his own country,
and the land of Israel remained bare.

Then the king of Elmosal, sent people to dwell in the
land and to till it, instead of the children of Israel who had
left it.

But when those people came to dwell in that land, [wild]
beasts rent them asunder and devoured them, and prevailed
against them in all the borders of the land.

Then they sent word to the king in their own tongue, and
asked him to send them Urias the priest, to give them the

♦ Or, being ordained. t »•«•. Mosul or AssTria.



IV.] REIGN OF HEZEKIAE. 193

law, so that wild beasts should no longer come near them, and
hurt them.

When the king heard this he sent them Urias the priest,
and commanded him to give them a law, for them to keep, so
that the wild beasts hurt them not.

Urias the priest came, and did as the king had commanded
him, and he gave the people the law of the Jews ; it was in
their hands, they recited it and ruled themselves after it. And
those were the Samar; whom the king, of whom we have
just spoken, had sent to till the land of Israel.

Then Yunathan died, and after him reigned Akaz his son,
who did well before God, and then died.

After him reigned his son Hezkias, when he was twenty-five
years old ; and he reigned twenty -two years ; and did good,
and judgment, equity and justice ; and he pleased the Lord ;
he kept His law and His commandments ; he brake down the
idols, and destroyed their houses.

But in the fourth year of his reign, came Sanakreb king of
Assarium, and took away captive all that were left and sent
them to Babylon.

But Hezkias served the Lord God, and fulfilled His law, until
he fell sick and became very weak, and was in great distress
by reason of his sickness ; his heart suffered, and he said to
himself, " Woe is me ! I shall die without a son to reign after
me."

And in his sickness he wept before Grod and said, " Woe is
me, Lord ! behold, I die without a son ; and behold the
promise Thou madest unto David, shall fail in me ; and the
kingdom shall pass from the house of David.''

Then God looked upon his sorrow of heart, and upon his
sickness, for his sickness was sore. And God had pity on him
and gave him fifteen years over and above the rest of his days;
and he recovered from his sickness.

Then three years after he had recovered, and God had
raised him from his sickness, he begat Manasseh. And he

13



194 TEE BOOK OF ADAM AND EVE. [book

died, rejoicing greatly at having a son born unto him, to sit
upon his throne.



CHAPTER X.

After him Manasseh his son reigned twelve years in
Jerusalem. He did much evil, and made the people of
Jerusalem worship idols.^^

Then when he had thus transgressed the law of God, Isaias
the prophet came to him and rebuked him for the wickednesses
he had wrought.

Then Manasseh was angry with him, and commanded valiant
and wicked men to take Isaias the prophet, and to saw him
asunder with a saw of wood,* from his head down to his feet,
among the trees of the wilderness ; and then to cast him to
the beasts [of the field] to devour him. And they did so to
him.i*

Isaias was then one hundred and twenty years old. His
raiment was of shaggy goat^s hair upon his body; and he
fasted regularly every second day [of the week] all the days of
his life.

Then Manasseh died ; and after him reigned his son Amots,
who did evil before God ; for he offered sons and daughters
in sacrifice unto idols.

Then Amots died; and after him reigned Yusias his son.
He was twenty years old when he [began] to reign, and
continued twenty-two years in his kingdom in the city of
Jerusalem. He did justice and right before God; and kept
the Passover of the Lord, such as the children of Israel never
were able to keep, except the one Moses kept for them in the
wilderness. This king purified Jerusalem of all wickedness.

But Pharhon the lame, king of Egypt, killed Yusias in
Carmelos.

* i.e., a saw used in sawing or felling trees.



IV.] CAPTIVITY OF BABYLON. 195

Then after him Akaz reigned three months. But Pharhon
bound Akaz in chains and sent him into the land of Egypt ;
and he died in that place.

After his death Yuakem his brother reigned fourteen years ;
but in the third year of his reign, Nabukadanatsor came to the
city of Jerusalem, and God delivered Yuakem into his hands ;
and Yuakem was under his orders, bowed unto him, and paid
him tribute ; he then sickened and died.

After him reigned his brother Yekonias three months ; then
came Nabukadanatsor who took captive Yekonias and all his
army, and sent them to Babylon.

On the way thither, Daniel's mother gave him birth. Anania,
Azaria, and Misael, sons of Yekonias, were also bom on the first
transportation of Yuakem.

Then Yekonias died, and after him Zedekias reigned twelve
years. This was the end of kings that reigned over the
children of Israel, and all Judah; after them no king was
left to them.

And at the end of the fourteenth year of Zedekias, Nabuka-
danatsor came and transported all the people of Jerusalem, as
far as the west, and as far as the river Euphrates, and as far as
the great river. He laid waste Tyre, and burnt Hiram king of
Tyre with fire, who had reigned five hundred years.

Then after this Nabukadanatsor went into Egypt, and put to
death Pharhon ; destroyed his army, and laid waste the land
of Egypt ; and then took the city of Jerusalem. And God
delivered Zedekias into his hands, whom he took, and brought
out before idols, and set him before the people, and slew his
children before him, without pity. He then put out his eyes,
bound his hands with chains and his feet with fetters; and sent
him to Babylon, because of his folly, and of the evil he had
done to Irmias* the prophet, by casting him into springs of
water in a marsh."

• Jeremiah.

196 THE BOOK OF ADAM AND EVE. [book

After this Nabuzaradan captain of the king's array, destroyed
the walls of Jerusalem, burnt the House of God with fire ; and
did all manner of evil to Jerusalem.

But Simeon the priest, found favour and grace with the
captain of the king's army, and requested him to give him the
house* of records ; and he gave him a command accordingly.

Then Simeon the priest came in and gathered together the
ashes of the books, and laid them in a pot in a vault, and he
took a censer of brass, and put fire therein, and threw pure
incense upon it, and hung it in the vault over the place in
which the ashes of the books lay.

But [Nebuzaradan] laid waste Jerusalem, like a wilderness.

And Jeremiah the prophet sat weeping and mourning over
Jerusalem twenty years, after which this prophet Jeremiah
went into the land of Kgypt, and died there.

But the writers and the interpreters destroyed the writings,
and the Hebrews changed the writings; and the Syrians and
the Greeks rejected many sections of those writings. So that
the children of the people could not ascertain [their kindred],
neither could men or women hear who were their fathers or
their mothers, except very few of them ;

And this was because of the laying waste of Jerusalem ; so
that until this day, nothing certain is found among the
writings, except the chief writings alone, which writings had
been translated before the ruin of Jerusalem.

Then again since some of the writings were altered, people
could not ascertain how they were married, and could not
know who were their wives or daughters ; they did not know
their names or their kindred ; nor the order of generations ;
neither did they know that of the priesthood.

And Jechonias remained twienty-seven years bound in prison
at Babylon. After that he was released by Marzuk king of
Babylon, who gave him to wife, a woman called Dalilah daughter

* Or, repository, ark, chest.



IV.] RETURN FROM THE CAPTIVITY. 107

of Eliakim, by whom he had Salathiel in Babylon. But
Jechonias, Salathiel's father, died at Babylon.

Then Salathiel took to wife Hadast, daughter of Elkanah ;
and had by her Zerubbabel. And Zerubbabel married a
woman whose name was Malka, daughter of Ezra the scribe ;
but he had no child by her in Babylon.

Then in the days of Zerubbabel, who was elder among
the children of Israel, a Persian king, called Cyrus, who
reigned over Babylon, took to wife a woman called Meshar,
sister of Zerubbabel, elder among the children of Israel ; and
he made her queen after the manner of the queens of Persia.
And when she became queen, she found favour with the king,
and asked him to show mercy to the children of Israel, and
to send them back to the city of Jerusalem.



CHAPTER XI.

But Cyrus loved much Meshar, sister of Zerubbabel, [even]
as his own soul.

So he gave an urgent order that they should go about the
whole land of the Chaldaeans, and gather together the children
of Israel into Babylon, the house of the kingdom ; and they
gathered them according to the king's order.

Then Cyrus said to Zerubbabel, his wife's brother, " Take
thy people and go to thy city Jerusalem ; and rebuild it as it
was at first.

Then when dutiful Cyrus had given this order concerning
the return of the children of Israel to Jerusalem, in the land of
the sanctuary ;

God appeared unto him in a vision during sleep, and said
unto him, "Because thou hast done this, they shall call thee
Cyrus the Messiahnic; and this name, Messiahnic, shall be
given thee, because thou hast sent back strangers to their own



198 THE BOOK OF ADAM AND EVE. [book

city ; and because thou hast given commandment concerning
the rebuilding of Jerusalem."

Then the children of Israel returned from the captivity of
Babylon, Zerubbabel was elder over them; and Josiah, son
of Zadok, of the sons of Aaron, was high priest over them ; as
the angel of God spake to the prophet Zachariah saying,
''Those two sons that stand before the Lord of the whole
earth shall minister unto them, as becomes their service."

Cyrus had assumed the kingdom two years, when the
captivity returned from Babylon ; and at the end of that year,
the five thousand years [spoken of j to Adam were fulfilled.

But when the children of Israel returned from Babylon they
had not the law, neither was there a book in their hands ;
.inasmuch as the voices of the prophets had departed from
among them.

So, when they came to Jerusalem and were settled in it,
Ezra the scribe came to the vault in which were the ashes of
the books, which Simeon the priest, had gathered together.

And Ezra found the censer that was full of fire, hanging
with [smoke of] incense rising from it on high.

Then Ezra prayed to God, wept abundantly, and spread his
hand towards the ashes of the books of the law and of the
prophets, and all of them three times.*

Then came the Spirit of God upon him, and the [same]
Spirit spake through him that had spoken through the
prophets. And he wrote the law and the prophets, and
made them new a second time.

And the fire which he found in the censer, is the divine fire
that was all the time in the House of God.

Then Zerubbabel settled in Jerusalem as king over the
children of Israel, and Josiah son of Zadok as high priest, with
Ezra the scribe of the law and the prophets also, as chief over
the children of Israel.

* Eutych., Nazam al-j., p 226.



IV.] THEY REBUILD THE TEMPLE. 199

And the children of Israel kept a solemn Passover unto the
Lord, when they returned from their captivity at Babylon.

These were the three great, full and solemn feasts of the
Passover, which the children of Israel kept during their
existence. The first Passover was in Egypt, in the days of
Moses ; the second Passover was in the days of king Josiah ;
and the third Passover was when they returned from their
captivity in Babylon.



CHAPTER XII.

From the first transportation to Babylon, when they carried
away Daniel's mother, and she brought him forth, unto the
second year of Cyrus the Persian, are seventy years, during
which the children of Israel were captive, according to the
prophecy of holy* Jeremiah the prophet.

And the children of Israel began to build the House of God,
in the days of Zerubbabel, of Josiah the son of Zadok, and of
Ezra the scribe. And they were forty-six years building it,
until it was finished, as it is written in the holy Gospel — that
they were forty-six years building it.

Moreover, scribes arranged tables of genealogy, and recorded
the names of the men ; but they could not record the names of
the women because they knew them not, except very few.

But, my brethren, I have watched much, and I have
searched long in the books of the Greeks and of the ancient
Hebrews, and I have found the name of the women written in
them.

For I found that when the children of Israel came from
Babylon, that Zerubbabel begat Abiud of Maukabf the daughter
of Ezra the scribe ; and that Abiud took to wife Tsamita the
daughter of Zadok the high priest, and she bare Eliakim.

♦ Or, innoceut. t Called Mulka at p. 197.



200 TEE BOOK OF ADAM AND EVE. [book

And Eliakim married Hasbia, the daughter of Aram, and
brought forth Azar. And Azar begat Zadok of Lebaida.
And Zadok took to wife Kalem, the daughter of Waikam, who
gave birth to Akim.

And Akim married Asbaidi, who gave birth to Eliud. And
Eliud married Awad, the daughter of Gasulius, who gave birth
to Azar.

And Azar married Hayat, daughter of Walha, who brought
forth Mattan ; and Mattan married Sabartyal the daughter of
Phulius, who brought forth twins, namely, Jacob and Joachim.

And Jacob married Gadat, the daughter of Eleazar, who
gave birth to Joseph the betrothed of Mary. And Joachim,
the brother of Jacob, married Hannah the daughter of Makah ;
and she brought forth the pure Virgin Mary ; and of her was
born Christ.

The former scribes, however, could not find a good lineage
for the Virgin and her father, or kindred; wherefore did the
Jews crucify Christ, and taunt Him, and mock Him, and say to
Him, " Show us the fathers of Mary the Virgin and her people,
and what is her genealogy.'* Therefore did they blaspheme
her and Christ.

But henceforth shall the mouth of those unbelieving Jews be
closed ; and they shall know that Mary is of the seed of David
the king, and of that of the patriarch Abraham.

Moreover, the unbelieving Jews had no registers to guide
them aright, neither did they know, how the lines of kindred
ran at first, inasmuch as the law and the prophets were three
times burnt [out] from them.

The first time in the days of Antiochus, who burnt down the
whole House [of God] ; The second time they burnt those
books in the days of Qablar the great king of Mosul ; And the
third time* they burnt the books was at the transportation by
king Nabukadanatsor when Abumirdan came and burnt the

Great. Nazam al-j., p. 309.

House of God, and destroyed the walls of Jerusalem; when
Simeon the priest asked of him the store of books, and he gave
them to him.



CHAPTER XIII.

But we will make known to you all the genealogies in detail.

And Manasseh married Amasisan, and begat Amos ; and

And Joachim married Phurdia, the daughter of Phulek,
and begat Jechonias and his brother during the captivity of

And Marsas who reigned over Babylon, released Jechonias
from prison, and gave him to wife, a woman whose name was
Dalilah, the daughter of Eliakim, by whom he had Salathiel.

But Jechonias died at Babylon ; where Salathiel continued
forty-nine years after him, and married Hadast, the daughter
of Elkauah, and begat Zerubbabel. And Zerubbabel married

Mary.



IV.] THE SEVEN WEEKS OF DANIEL. 203

CHAPTER XIV.

And here, O my brother, behold, I have settled for thee
that which is true, and I have revealed unto thee the genealpgy,
and laid for thee the firm foundation, which not one of the
writers and of the wise men, could make known.

But, O my brother, give me thy heart and make it clean,
that I may tell thee what things remain, and how the reckoning
of generations come all round to reach unto and to stand firm
by the birth of Christ.

But after the birth of Christ there remained no more
trustworthy reckoning [of kindred] to the Jews. For Christ
was the end of the generations ; He took it and gave it
to us.

But let me tell thee, O my brother, that the five thousand
years from [the creation of] Adam, did not end before
the days of Cyrus, king of Persia. Then from Cyrus to the
sufferings of our Saviour Jesus Christ, even as the faithful
Daniel prophesied, saying, " After seven weeks Christ shall
come, and shall be put to death."

Now seven weeks are four hundred and ninety years ; for a
great week is of seventy years. But in that the prophet said,
"After seven years," he pointed to the ten years [that
remained] ; for he did not say, " Christ shall come at the end
of the seven weeks,'^ but he said, " After seven weeks [He
shall come] and be put to death."

But the meaning here of '' after," is — those ten years, that
make up the five hundred years. And that is the fulfilment of
the promise that God made to Adam, that He would save him
at the end [of that time] .^^

Henceforth are the mouths of the Jews struck dumb, and to
them belongs shame, because they blaspheme and say that
Christ is not yet come.

But while they say so, they, of necessity, believe the first



204 TEE BOOK OF ADAM AND EVE. [book

statement [of the prophets] to be true and the last to be a lie.
If they say " Christ came/^ believing, as they do, the prophecy
of the prophet Daniel, they now see that the prophecy of
Daniel is fulfilled, and that the House of God is laid waste
[and taken] from them ; that the priesthood is abolished, and
that the seven weeks were fulfilled, and that Christ came, and
was put to death ; and that the Holy City was laid waste by
king Vespasian and his son Titus.

" But let me also tell thee, my brother, that in the thirty-
second year of the reign of Augustus Caesar, Christ was bom
in Bethlehem of Judah, as it is written in the Gospel. And,
behold, it is made plain to us, that Christ came when the
prophecy was fulfilled.

As Micah the prophet said, " But thou, O Bethlehem, [in
the] land of Judah, thou art not lower than the kings of Judah ;
for from thee shall come a king, that shall feed my people
Israel."

Let the Jews now feel ashamed of themselves ; for if they
make Daniel a liar, they cannot again make the prophet Micah
a liar; yet if they will make them liars still, behold, Christ
was bom in Bethlehem [in] the land of Judah.

And when He was born at Bethlehem [in] the land of
Judah, a star in the East made it known, and was seen by
Magi. That star shone in heaven, amid all the other stars ;
it flashed and was like the face of a woman, a young virgin,
sitting among the stars, flashing, as it were carrying a little
child of a beautiful countenance.

From the beauty of His looks, both heaven and earth shone,
and were filled with His beauty and light above and below;
and that child was on the virgin woman's arms ; and there was
a cloud of light around the child's head, like a crown.

But it was a custom of the Chaldaeans to observe the stars
of heaven ; to take counsel from them ; and they were num-
bered by them.

So when they saw the star of the figure we have just



IV.] THE STAB AND THE MAGI. 205

mentioned, they were greatly troubled, and said among them-
selves, '* Surely the king of the Helonseans is putting himself
in battle array against us ! "

And they inquired among soothsayers and philosophers,
until they ascertained the fact and discovered that the king of
the children of Israel was born.

As to this matter of the stars, the ChaldaBans used to work
it out, and to take counsel from the power* of the stars ; so
that they knew every event that should be, ere it happened.
Likewise the captains of large ships, wh^n they went on a
voyage upon the seas, [knew beforehand] the signs of winds,
of whirlwind, of gloom, and of thick darkness.

Thus the Magi when they read in their books, knew from
them, that Christ should be born in the land of Judah.

So they went upon a high mountain in the east, while
coming westward ; and they took with them the presents they
had prepared ere they set off on their journey ; that is, gold,
frankincense and myrrh — that had been with Adam in the Cave
of Treasures. Gold, namely as unto a king ; frankincense, as
unto God; and myrrh, as for His death.



CHAPTER XV.

But when Hor, king of Persia, heard who it was they called
King of kings, he prepared his chariot and mounted it.
Basantar also, king of Saba, came out ; and Karsundas, king
of the East, got himself ready and came out also.

They were all in great tribulation, and also all other kings
in the borders of the West trembled with them, and every
country in the East was in great alarm at the sight of that
glory.

* i.e.y inflaence.



206 THE BOOK OF ADAM AND EVE. [book

Then the Magi while on their journey said, " This star has
not risen but for some great event/' And they went on their
way until they came to Jerusalem.^'''

But when Herod heard of it, he was troubled, and called the
Magi to him, and communed with them ; and they rehearsed
unto him the [whole] thing.

Then he and all his hosts trembled ; and he said to the
Magi, " Go ye, and inquire diligently concerning this Child ;
and when ye have found Him, come and tell me, that I also
may go and worship Him.

Then the Magi went forthwith to Bethlehem, and found
Christ, and offered Him their gifts. But they did not return
to Herod ; they went back to their own country.

But after they were gone, Herod was wroth, and com-
manded all children of two years and under, to be put to
death.

Then an angel of the Lord appeared unto Joseph, and said
to him, " Arise, and take the Child and His mother, and go to
the land of Egypt j and abide there until I tell thee." And
Joseph weut into the land of Egypt.

Then Herod began to slay all children, until he had not left
one. And he died of an evil death.

After his death an angel of the Lord appeared unto Joseph
in the land of Egypt. And Joseph came up out of Egypt,
and dwelt at Nazareth, he, the child, and Mary His mother.

And they abode at Jerusalem until Christ was thirty years of
age, and was baptized by John.

This John lived all his days in the wilderness, and his food
was locusts and wild honey.

And in the nineteenth year of Tiberius, our Lord Christ was
crucified. He died in the body, and was buried, and rose
again from among the dead on the third day ; as it is written.

And He went down into hell, and saved Adam and Eve, and
all their righteous seed, according to His first and firm promise.



IT.] FULFILMENT OF PROPHEGJ. 207

And thus He fulfilled all tliat the prophets had prophesied
concerning Him.

He then went up into heaven; whence He will come
again with His holy angels, to judge the quick and dead.

Unto Him be glory, and thanksgiving, and honour, and
power and worship for ever. Amen.

NOTES TO BOOK I.



1 " He rooted up from elsewhere,
trees no larger than the horns (antennae)
of locusts, and planted the garden full
of them," {Bereshith Rabhah, sect. fol.
18, ed. Frkf.; and Yalkut Ruheni^ foi-
ls, ed. Armst.) E. Abarhanel, how-
ever, denies that ; and says that God
did not take trees from elsewhere to
plant them there j but the meaning is,
that the garden and the trees thereof,
were a plant of His own planting, to
take pleasure therein — the perfection of
His creation. ( Comm. in Pent, fol. 22. )
Yalkut Rubeni ( f ol. 1 3, ed. Amst. ), quotes
from the Bk. Zoar, that as God made
two Paradises, one on earth for Adam,
and one above for the righteous who
are to be there girt with light, so also
has He made two Gehennas ; one under
the earth, and one above it. The one
below, is for all who do not believe in
God, and have not entered into cove-
nant with Him. But the Gehenna
above is for all Israelites who have
broken the commandments, and care
not to repent.

2 The Angel of the Face revealed
unto Moses the creation of the world,
and how on the third day God created
the waters, dry lands, woods, fruit trees,
and the Garden of Eden, for delight.
(^Kufale, p. 7 ; and K. Maim., SanJied. X)

3 R. Abarbanel renders ]"*731p7D
(Targum Onk., Gen. iii, 8), by tlHlD
y"lS3 the utmost limit of the earth
created at the beginning (Comm. in
Pent, fol. 22). It was planted on



a mountain [the Holy Mountain] in
the north ; eastward ; whence flowed
the rivers down into the world. (^Sode
Raza, in Talk. Rubeni, fol. 13.)

4 S. Ephrem had a different idea of
Paradise. In his first sermon on this
subject (vol. iii, p. 564), he compares
Paradise to the orbit of the moon, that
embraces within itself both the earth
and the seas. (S. Chrys., Uom. xiii, in
Gen.)

6 Then the Lord God [the Word of
the Lord, Ta/rg. Hier} said to the
ministering angels : " Behold, Adam is
alone in the earth as I am alone in the
high heavens, and men shall come
from him who shall know good from
evil. Had he kept My commandment
he would have lived and continued
[stood] like the Tree of Life, for ever.
But now since he has transgressed, let
us decree to drive him out of Eden ere
he take of the Tree of Life. And God

a Jewish fiction and fabulous— for is
the image of God and of angels one
and the same ?

In the Coran, snr. vi, 14, Mahomet
inveighs against al-mushrikin, those
who gave companions to God, and
worshipped them, in the shape of angels'
together with Him. And in sur. xxxvii,
163, and elsewhere, he further blames
them — and the former inhabitants of
Mecca in particular — for believing that
angels were of the female sex, and
daughters of God. " Have we created
angels females," says he, " and do we
prefer daughters to sons ?" etc.

6 Adam and his wife were seven
years in the Garden of Eden, tilling and
keeping it, " and we," says the Angel of
the Face, " gave him work and taught
him everything needful [lit. visible] for
husbandry ; and he laboured at it, and
gathered the fruit thereof, and laid it
in store for himself and his wife."
(K'nfale,i>. 13.)

7 The air of Paradise is full of sweet
and fragrant smells ; Adam drew breath
from it, and grew thereby. (S. Ephrem,
8erm. X, on Par., vol. iii, p. 595.)

8 Adam the first man, king of all
that is on the earth, was created on the
Friday of the first week in Nisan, the
first month of the first year of the world
(Bar. Hebraeus, Syr., Dyn. i, p. 3). After
having created everything, God said to
His angels : " Let us create man after
our own image and similitude, knowing
good and evil, and with the power of
doing either." Then there appeared an
open right hand, with particles of the
four elements in it ; into which God
breathed a living soul, whence Adam
came into existence. (Abulpharaj.
Arab. Hist. Dyn., p. 5.)

God created Adam in the last hour of
the first Friday. He created him of the
surface of the earth, taking a handful of
earth of all colours, He mixed it up with
divers waters («7rti r»Jc wppaQ y^t



<pvpa9ei<Ttis iytyovti Joseph. Ant. Jvd.,
lib. i, c. i, p. 2); red earth being virgin
soil ; and having formed him. He breathed
a breath into him, and he became a living
and sensible creature, after having been
a senseless vessel of clay. ( Jelal, and
Jahias on Coran, sur. ii, 39.) At sur.
Ixxvi, 1, on the words hal ata 'ola
'I insHni, Jelal says (according to
Maracci, p. 769), that Adam had been
forty years a form of clay no one ever
mentioned, for there was nothing re-
markable or to be noticed (remembered)
— in it, until God breathed into him the
breath of life.— Truly such writers, and
their readers, are easily pleased ; for if,
Jelal says, Adam was created on the
Friday of the creation, where had he
been, as a figure of clay, during those
forty years ?

Pyrrhon in his history, says indeed,
that Adam came into the Garden of
Paradise on the fortieth day [of his
creation] dW'oi;*; olSa irov SierpiPs
irpoTtgov 6 'Addfi, t^w rov Trapadtiffov
TtaffapaKovra Siayuv t'luipag, but I
don't know, says M. Glycas, where
Adam could have been spending forty
days outside Paradise. (Annal. i, p.
156.) This legend was probably derived
from the XtiTTq riveaiQ, or Ethiopic
Kufale, where we read in ch. iii, p. 12,
" When Adam had passed forty days in
the land in which he was created, we,
the Angel of the Face, brought him
into the Garden of Eden ; and Eve his
wife, after eighty days. Wherefore it
is written in the tables of heaven, that
a woman continues forty days until
cleansed, for the birth for a man-child,
and eighty days for that of a female.

Philo (QucBst. XXV, Annen. in Gen.)
alludes to this, when he says that
" man's " formation being more perfect
than woman's , gisu hidetsav jamanagi,
only required half the time, that is forty
days ; but woman's nature being less
perfect, took grgnagi avwts twice as

many days — eighty." [This may have
been clear to Philo, but to no one else.]

Targ. Jonathan in Gen. ii. says
that God took dnst fromSC7"Tp!I3 IVZ
the sanctnary and from the four winds
[quarters] of the world, mixed it up
with waters from the whole world, and
made man TlTlT D^riB? pl21D brown,
black and white — and He " breathed into
him a living soul, to light up his eyes,
and to quicken his ears to hearken."

Ebn-Ali adds that while Adam was
thus a figure of clay — either forty nights
or forty years [riadapaKOffTy r'lfispa
Geo. Syncell. from XfTm) rivtaic, or
KufaW] Satan came and kicked it ; and
as it gave a sound, he said, "This is
not created, but to rule and govern."
And God said to His angels, " When I
have animated it, ye shall fall down and
worship him." They did so, but Satan
would not, etc. (Maracci, p. 22). Man
was as high as a palm-tree, and the hair
of his head was long and thick, etc.
(Jahias, p. 270.)

But Masudi (Maruj ez-zahaibi, p.
50, sq.) improves upon this account, and
says, that God having finished the earth,
peopled it with [jins] genii or demons,
one of which was Eblis — before He
created Adam. They began to fight
among themselves, and were driven to
distant islands ; while Eblis was made
regent of the sky [the heaven of the
world], but harboured pride in his
breast, and refused to worship Adam
when created. Then God sent Gabriel
and Michael, and after them the Angel
of Death, who took a handful of clay of
red, black and white colours; whence
men are of different complexions. The
first man was called Adam [from adim,
surface] , and left forty years, some say
one hundred and twenty years, a figure
of clay. The angels passed by and
gtared at it, and Eblis himself was
astonished, and gave it a kick that
made it resound. Afterwards, when



commanded to worship Adam, he re-
fused, saying to God, " I am Thy vicar
on earth, created of fire, with wings and
a glory round my head — but this one
is of clay." Then God cursed Eblis,
hurled him down from heaven, but gave
him respite, until a fixed time — ^the day
of the resurrection, etc.

R. Meir says God made the first man
of dust gathered from the whole world ;
and R. Oshaya says his body was made
of dust from Babel (or Babylon), his
head from the land of Israel, and his
other members from different lands.
But^iJochananBar Jlanina^ajs that
there being twelve hours in the day :
At hour one, God gathered the dust ; at
two, He formed the mass ; at three, He
spread out his members ; at four, He put
breath into him ; at five. He set him up
on his feet; at six, he called the names
[of the beasts] ; at seven, He joined him
to Eve ; at eight, they begat twins ; at
nine, they were ordered not to take food
from the tree ; at ten, they trans-
gressed ; at eleven, they were judged ;
and at twelve, they were driven from
Paradise. (Talmud Bab. Sanhedrin, p.
75, 76, ed. W.) The same story is also
told in P. Avoth. of R. Nathan, fol. 2.

642) speaks of heretics, who taught
that Adam was created blind. Tv<p\bc

1 1 God drove Adam and Eve from the
Garden of Eden abroad in the earth, at
the ninth hour of the same Friday on
which they had been created at the first
honr. (Abulphar. Byn. i, p. 6; Geo.
Syncellns, Chron. p. 5.)

from Paradise at the ^sixth hoa» on
the Friday, how could they have been
created at the eleventh hour on that day,
according to the Goran ? .

12 According to the Kufale Adam and
Eve left the Garden of Eden exactly
seven years, two months, and seventeen
days, after having been brought into it
from the land of Elda, where they had
been created, and to which they now
returned. On this day [the 10th of
May, Syncel.] Adam offered a sweet
smelling sacrifice of incense and other
spices, at sun-rise ; and on this day were
all creatures driven from the garden,
and their speech taken from them. For
mitil_thB day Adaj m was driven fr om
the garden, all animals, birds, and
reptiles, had one speech of their own.
(Kufale, p. 14, 15.) Geo. Syncellus adds
to this from the XtTrriy Plvefftc (p. 15, ed.
Dind.) " that all animals ofiofoiva tJvai
— Tolc irpuTO'TrXdaroiQ spake the same
language as Adam and Eve before their
fall (so also Joseph. Ant. Jud., lib. i, c. i,
4) ; for the serpent spake to Eve with a
human voice " — a statement Syncellus
did not believe ; albeit he says, " we do
not doubt the serpent was four footed



before the fall, and afterwards, became
creeping. "

Speaking of the Xtirri) VevifftQ, the
probable Greek original of the Ethiopic
Kufale, of Jewish authorship, and
possibly alluding to this present work
of Christian origin, Geo. Syncellus says,
" he was driven to quote from them
against his will, on account of the
naming of the beasts by Adam, of the
fall, etc., ti Kai /xi) Kupia elvai SoksI
although such particulars do not seem
to be authentic " (p. 7).

13 And the King of Light commanded
me ^bel Zivo [who with Anush and
Shetel, attended Adam] saying, " Go to
the world of darkness which is full of
evil, and bring out every thing to light
— let the earth be formed, and bring
forth food and every living thing, male
and female. Let man and woman be,
and call them Adam and Eve ; and let
all things, even the Angels of Fire,
serve him. With the aid of Fetahil
[Demiurgus] the world will come to
light." Adam and Eve were then created,
and a soul given them, in the garden.
" Go then, ^bel Zivo [Brilliant Ruler]
and cause Adam's heart to shine, and
establish him so that his mind shine ;
converse with him, thou and the two
angels that are to go about with him in
the world. And teach him and Eve
and their children, to eschew evil and
Satan, and to practise righteousness
in the earth," etc. (Codem NasarcBTis
i, p. 62, 64, 66.)

Adam was clothed in the brightness
of life, and three pure Genii — ^bel,
Anush and Shetel were given him for
companions, etc., i, p. 193; ii, p. 120, etc.

world ; a matter I will diligently try to
prove " (the discrepancy between 5600
and 5534 is explained further on).
The general opinion among Jews has
always been that this world will last
7000 years. Thus in Avoda Zara, p. 1 7,
we read, " 6000 years will be to the
world — 2000 years 1 mil of emptiness ;
2000 years miJl of the law; 2000
years, the days of the Messiah in our
manifold afflictions." These, adds the
commentary, are determined according
to the days of the week, and the last
1000 years are the Sabbath. This
account of the first 2000 years does not
agree with what is said elsewhere, that
" the law was given before the creation,
and that Adam and the Patriarchs had
it."

6 ©eoc; " Why then did God hallow the
seventh day ?" asks Cedrenus. " Because
whereas every other day had within
itself the blessing resting on the works
done therein [that were very good] the
seventh day had no such distinction.
God, therefore, hallowed it as a day
of rest, Kal wf rvirog rrjs t^tofiriQ

which some say is the Revelation of

15 And the Lord called me [^bel
Zivo], and paid, " Go, tell Adam, with
a clear voice, of the most high King
of Light ; of the kings of praise, who
stand praising Him ; of the creatures of
light, that live for ever. Teach them to



pray and to give thanks, to stand pray-
ing to the King of Light, Lord of all
creatures, three times a day and twice in

"the living soul," that it became (or
was) in man sbbtStt m"l7 a speaking

" missing link " possesses].

16 After God had given His com-
mandment to Adam and Ere, not to
touch the tree, Satan said within him-
self, I shall not be able to make Adam
fall, but I can make Eve do so. He
then drew near to her, and while
whispering in her ears, he shook the
tree with his hands and feet, until the
fruit thereof fell to the ground ; so that
Eve should take of it without touching
even the root of the tree. (Pirke Avoth
of R. Nathan, fol. 2.)

Quoniam in hora gloriae ejus intravit
serpens, et invenit Evam solam, et
decepit Evam. {Protoev. Jacohi, c. xiii,
ed. Thilo.)

And S. Ephrem (in Gen , vol. i, p.
31), says that, Eve trusting to what the
serpent said^_gtg~the fruit first ^oping
thereby to obtain divinity, and tht^ to
beco me super ior to her husband, whom
she wished to rule, rather than ^bey.
When, _ bowever, she f6uhd~Tier8elf
deceived, she gave him of the fruft, in
order that he should fare as she did.
And she did not die at once, lest Adam
should be terrified at the sight of her
death, and so, not eat of the fruit.

that in the hour God created Adam,
He made him D13''2Tm3S, dvSpoywog
man and woman ; as it is written :
" male and female created He them,"
Gen. i, 27. But R. Shemuel Bar
Nathan, holds that God created Adam
)''D^!J'n2 V^, ^t-7rpo(7W7rov, with two
faces ; the one looking one way, and
the other looking the other way. He
then sawed them asunder, into two
backs, a back to the one and a back to
the other, etc, {Bereshith Rab., fol. 9 ;
and Yalk. Shimoni, fol, 6, 20), to which
Matnoth Kah. adds, that one side was
male and the other female. The same
story is told in Talmud Bab. (^Berachoth,
p, 121, ed, W.) where the commentary
(R, Shelomoh) adds, that God did not
" saw " Adam asunder, but split (HblJ)
him in two, and made Eve out of one
half. And elsewhere (Ervibin, p, 35),
R. Jeremiah Ben Eliezer, repeating the
same thing, founds his belief on Psalm
cxxxix. 6, " Thou hast beset me, behind
and before."

Adam and Eve were twenty years
old when created. "1D37 " dust " is
masculine and ^Z3^N " earth " is
feminine ; and He who formed them
made them thus of the dust of the earth,
male and female. And God made Adam

R. Abarbanel (Com. in Pent, fol. 17)

being as it were the perfection of His
creatures. And that, as some say,

reached up to an idea of God — clad in
the light God created at first.

R. M. Maimonides (quoted in m7^^!l
mwnpa, fol. 9) says, that God ad-
dressed the earth when He said, " Let
us make man." The earth was to give
him all his earthy matter, and God, all
his spiritual and intellectual faculties.
The same is also told in y\\)'^ '* /3, fol.
15 ; and again repeated by R. Bekai.
See note 25.

19 The tree had not in itself good and
eyil, for there could be nothing evil in
Paradise ; '6qoq 5k stsOt) stti ry 0ury
irpoQ yvfxvaffiav ttjq i\sv9t(>i6r7]roc ;
but the tree was set up as a mark (or
limit) in order to bring out Adam's
freedom of action— whether to obey
(good) or to disobey (evil). For his
knowledge of either was before the com-
mandment given, not to touch of the
fruit of the tree. (Cedrenus, Hist. Com-
mend., p. 13.)

20 When God said to his angels : " I,
indeed, will put a [khaliph] vicar in
the earth " — and commanded them to
worship him, and they did so. But
Eblis [Satan] would not ; he ( Goran,
Bur. ii, .30, sq.) was proud, and became
one of the infidels — then God asked him:
" Why wilt thou not worship Adam ? "
" Because," replied Eblis, " I am better
than he ; Thou didst create me of fire, but
him of mud," etc. {Goran, sar. vii, 12 and
9). Then Satan, or the serpent, made
Adam and Eve fall from Paradise to
the earth: Adam in Serandib [Ceylon ;
Adam's Peak] and Eve at Jeddali in
Yemen, where she was buried (ihid.
ibid.) [I visited her tomb in 1841 ; her
head is said to be at one end of the
burial ground, her body under the wely
in the centre of it, and her feet at the
farther end, some hundred yards apart.
The Arab who took me to see it, could
not help saying : Yd Khawajah, hi
thaweeU, wallah ! sir, she was long
indeed !J



Ibn-Batntah (Travels, vol. iv, p. 179,
sq.) gives a description of Adam's
Peak in Serandib, of the two ways, for
Adam and Eve, to the summit ; of the
print of the foot, sunk into a black rock ;
of trees whose leaves when eaten, restore
old age to youth, etc.

Masudi tells the same story, but adds,
that some of the fig-leaves with which
Adam was girt about, having been
scattered by the wind in his fall from
Paradise, those leaves became the sweet
spices for which Ceylon is celebrated.
(Masudi, ch. iii, p. 60, 61.)

21 R. Eliezer improves upon the
account given in Beresh. Eabhah, quoted
above (note 18), and says the first man
reached from earth to the sky, and from
east to west when he lay down. But
after his transgression God laid His
hand upon him 1lD"^37D1 and made him
small i as it is said Psalm cxxxix. 6,
" Thou hast beset me, etc., and laid Thy
hand upon me." So also R. Jehudah
avers in the name of all the Rabbis of
blessed memory that it was so. (Talmud
Bab. Hagigah, p. 23.) While reading the
Kand jur, I often wondered there could be
men found to write and to believe such
things. But they are not more absurd
than the lore of the Talmud, whereof
we read among other warnings : " My
son, give heed to the words of the writers
(Rabbis) rather than to the law itself."
(Erubin, p. 42.) " For he who has only
S"1pZ3 the text of the Bible, without the
Talmud, is like one that has no God."
(Share tsedek, fol. 9 Eis.) And " to
contradict such teaching, is 73? pblPTiD
n3"^DB7n like one who would difier
from, or contradict the Shekinah "
(Presence of God, or Holy Ghost,
according to Sepher Tezirah, p. 112, ed.
Rittang). And for a man to go from
the Talmud and to JlDbn "^2113

22 Atch. xxvi (ii,p. 276) Maandi tells
of a wonderful cup said to hare be-
longed to Adam, that always remained
full, however much was drunk out of
it, whose virtue Alexander the Great
tried on his visit to Ceylon. And
Ibn Batutah (vol. iv, p. 167, sq.) relates
his adventures on his pilgrimage to
Adam's foot, the print of which is of
an enormous size. [But is it not also
Buddha's foot ?] Hyde in his notes
to Peritsol (_Itinera Mundi, p. 2.5)
refutes the etymology of Taprobana
from Div (isle) Rohan — the name for
Adam's Peak in the Coran; and proposes
to bring " Serandib," from Selen, or "Sei-
lan-dib," island of Seylan — Singhala.]

El-kazwini (Ajdih i, p. 165), speaks
of Jebel Serandib upon which Adam
alighted — which shines with gold up to
heaven, and is seen from a great dis-
tance by sea-faring men. There is the
print of Adam's foot sunk in the stone
and about seventy yards long. The reason
for which there is only one foot is —
that Adam rested the other on the
bottom of the sea.

23 On the second week, says the
Angel of the Face, we brought all the
beasts to Adam, by command of God.
On the first day, beasts ; on the second,
cattle; on the third, birds; on the fourth,
all that moves (creeps) on the face of
the earth ; and on the fifth, all that
moves in the waters ; and Adam called
them all by their names, and that which
he called them, was their name. (Kufale,
p. 11.)

24 Immediately after the transgression,
Adam and Eve lost the angelic vision
and intelligence they had before they
transgressed God's commandment. And
now their sight and power of discerning
became limited only to matters corporeal
and sensible. (S. Ephrem, vol. i, p. 139.)

Bereshith Rahhah (Gen. ii, 7; and
Jalkut Ruheni, fol. 13), says " That
God gave Adam a twofold nature, partly



of things above or divine, and partly of
things earthly, such as eating, drinking ;
and as to heavenly gifts, he was to stand
over ' ministering angels.' " [These
were called mE7n "•Dsb^ who were
appointed to wait on him, namely,
JEbel, Shetel, and Anush (Cod. Nasanr.,
p. 192, etc.). They were, however,
frightened at Adam's size, that reached
from earth to heaven ( Talk. Ruheni, fol.
10) and so went up terrified, to ask God
what He had created," according to
Talkut Shimoni, on Gen. i.

It must then have been when they came
down back into Paradise, that according
to R. Jehndah {Yalkut Shimoni, fol. 4;
and Avoth of R. Nathan, fol. 2), " they
waited on Adam, roasted his meat, and
mixed his wine," ]">•< lb ]'»33D!3.]

" Other heavenly gifts of Adam were
speech, understanding, and faculty to
look on the ' ministering angels ;' for
animals cannot do it. For God said :
"If I make him only of the earth
(earthy) he will die ; if of heaven only,
he will live." So his Creator made him
up of those, and gave him a twofold
nature knowing good and evil ; for
animals know not the good." [See also
Talm. Bab. BeracTwth, p. 61, on this
same subject.]

But R. S. Ben Melech (Miclol Tophi
and Talk. Shimoni, fol. 6, 20, on Gen. i)
says, that God made use of the expres-
sion : " Let us make man," etc., merely
as a mark of respect, being about to
create Adam in presence of the four
elements, and to make him partly of
□"'iVby heavenly things, and partly
of D"'Dinnn things of below, earthy.
Instead of the four elements, Talmud
Bab. {Sanhedrin, p. 78), says they were
"VW m the great of the world ; and
Mid/rash Nehelam (quoted in Talkut
Ruiieni, fol. 10, ed. Amst.) says, that
" the Wheel, the Angel, and the Throne
(Ezech. i) joined together, saying, " Let
ns make man to be in fellowship with



216



THE BOOK OF ADAM AND EVE.



[book



ns, his breath from the Throne ; his
spirit from the Angel, and his soul from
the Wheel, in blessing, sanctification,
and unity.'' Talk. Euheni, id. however,
quotes another Midrash to show that
God gathered together all things aboye
and all things below, in fellowship with
Himself, to take their share in the
creation of m^.

25 K. Bekai (Pvrush 'oZ aWh., fol, 8,
ed. Crac.) sums up these and other
explanations of "Let us make man,"
etc. (1) l2tt?Dn ^ll ^27— according
to the text or simple sense, it is God and
the earth, He as Creator and the earth
as the mother of man; (2) as R. Kimchi
sajs, it is an expression of majesty ; or,
it is an address of God to Moses, when
He told him to write, etc.

26 When God, says R. Akha, came to
create man, He took counsel with the
ministering angels, and said to them:
" Let us make man." Then they asked
Him : " What will be his property ? "
" His wisdom shall be greater than
your own," said God ; and He brought
before them beasts and birds, and asked
them what they were. The angels did
not know. God then asked Adam, who
said, " This is an ox, an ass, a horse,
and a camel." And what is thy name?
said God. " It befits me to be called
• Adam,' because I was made of the
earth." " And what is My name ? " said
God to Adam. " It befits Thee," said
Adam, " to be called the Lord of all
Thy [creatures]." Then God said: That
is My name given Me first by Adam.
(Beresh. R., sect, xvii, fol. 20.)

And God said to the ministering
angels who were created on the second
day, and who ministered before Him : —
*' Let us make man after our own image
and similitude — with 248 members,
365 nerves ; " He spread a skin over
them, and filled the whole with flesh
and blood, etc. (Targ. Jonathan, B.
Vzziel'm Gen. i.)



[For a learned treatise on cbjJ and
nilDT with reference to Gen. i, 26, see
More Nevukim, sect, i, c. i, of R. Maimo-
nides.]

" When God set about creating the
world," said R. Jehudah, " He created
one legion of ministering angels, and
said to them : ' Is it your good pleasure
that we should create man? ' To which
they replied : ' What is man that Thou
art mindful of him? ' Then God thrust
His finger between them and consumed
them. And so with a second legion.
But the third said to Him : ' What the
first angels said availed nothing ; the
world is Thine ; do what seemeth the
best.' " ( Yalkut Shimoni, ed. Crac.,
fol. 4.)

"There is another tradition," says
R. Eliezer, "that God said to the Law
[which, according to the Talmud, was
created before the world], Let us make
man ! '' To which the Law answered :
" What, he the ruler of the world ? his
days will be shortened through sin ; a
child of wrath; and unless Thou be long
suflTering, it will be as if he had not
been." " Am I then long suflFering in
vain?" said God. "He then took
some earth, red, white and greenish,
from the four comers of the world ;
red, adorn, for Adam; white, for his
intestines ; and greenish for his body,"
&c. (lb. ihid., fol. 4.)

27 After Adam's transgression God
brought him, Eve, and the Serpent to
judgment : He said to the Serpent :
" Because thou didst that, thou shalt be
cursed among aU the beasts of the
field ; upon thy belly shalt thou go,
1^5J!Jpn^ "I^72"T| thy legs shall
be cut short; and thou shalt shed thy
skin once in seven years ; a deadly
venom shall be in thy mouth, and thou
shalt eat dust all the days of thy life.
I will put enmity between thee and the
seed of the woman; those who keep the
Law, shalt smite thee on the head; and

KfT'tt^a MDbDl and they will apply
that healing power to their heel, in the
days of King Messiah. But when the
Lord God said to Adam, " Thou shalt
eat the herb of the surface of the field,"
Adam answered and said : " By the
mercies that are of Thee, O Lord, let
me pray that we be not reckoned as
beasts of the field, to eat grass that
grows thereon ; Let ns arise and toil
with the labour of our hands, to eat
our food from the yield of the earth ;
so that from now a difference be made
between the children of men and the
beasts of the field," &c. (Targum,
Jonathan, in Gen. iii.)

In Bereshith Rah., sect, xix, we are
told that R. Meir taught " that the
serpent was wonderfully high ; " R.
Jonathan, ' ' that he was erect, and his
feet like canes ; " R. Jeremiah, " that
he was DTTlp"'2S (Epicurus) a heretic
or infidel ; " R. Simeon, " that he was
like a camel;" &c Maimonides (in
More Nevukim, sect, ii, c. 30) calls
attention to a passage in the Midrash,
where it is said "that D313 tt?n3n
the serpent was being ridden, and was
like a hairy camel ; and that he who
rode him was he who beguiled Eve,
namely, Samael, or Satan." And,
again : " When the serpent seduced
Eye, Samael was riding him ; but God
shall laugh at the serpent and at his
rider." Also, " When the serpent
came to Eve, he sprinkled his filth over
her ; " it will be wiped off the Israelites
who stood on Mount Sinai : but the
Gentiles retain it. (tbid.) The same
story is told somewhat differently by
R. Eliezer, in Talkut Shimoni, fol. 8,
25. According to Bereshith B., sect. 20,
and to Talk. Shimoni, fol. 9, 31, the
ministering angels came down and
1'»b2"TI Vl^ 1!J!Jp cut off his hands



and his feet, and his cries were heard
from one end of the world to the other.

•28 What did that old serpent, that
was jealous of Adam's glory, surrounded
by ministering angels, think at the
hour that he tempted Eve ? "I will go
and kill Adam and the woman his wife,
and I shall be king of the whole world;
and I shall walk erect, and enjoy all
the pleasures of the world.' ' Then God
said to him : " Therefore will I put
enmity between thee and man ; there-
fore shalt thon alone be cursed of all
beasts ; therefore, also, because of thy
pride, and wish to walk erect and to
enjoy all the pleasures of earth, shalt
thou creep on thy belly all the days of
thy life." (P. Avoth of R. Nathan, fol.
2 ; and B^ Zoar in Talkut Bubeni, fol.
16.)

The Rabbis hold that the serpent had
intercourse with Eve, whence Cain was
born and with him, sundrj- female infir-
mities ; and that Samael, not being
able (not having strength or power) to
seduce Adam, turned to Eve as to the
weaker of the two. (Zoar, in Yalk.
Bubeni, fol. 16.)

29 S. Ephrem (in Gen. vol. i, p. 3.5)
says the serpent was made to crawl on
its belly, " for having increased the pangs
of childbearing, through the seduction
of Eve." And at p. 135, "that the
serpent was deprived of feet because it
had hastened on them to come to Eve,
and had sought to be chief among
beasts."

30 It is said, howevpr, by R. Eliezer
(quoted in Eisenmenger's Entd. Jvd. i,
377), that Adam had a staff which he
gave to Enoch, Enoch to Noah, Noah to
Shem, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and
Joseph; after Joseph's death his house
was plundered, and the staff came into
the hands of Pharaoh, who planted it
in Jethro's garden. But when Moses
was grown up he found it there covered
with written characters ; he then took it



218



THE BOOK OF ADAM AND EVE.



[book



and told Jethro this rod shonld deliver
the children of Israel oat of Egypt,
&c.

In i3''n-i SB?» hw D^xs^n '•'nm

Paris. 1628, fol. 8, we read that " Moses
having fled to Midian, and having be-
come known to Jethro as an exile from
Egypt, was by him put in prison.
Moses, however, having pleased Zip-
porah, she fed him in prison, where she
always found him standing on his feet,
praying (fol. 9). She then told her
father that divine vengeance would over-
take him, if he maltreated his prisoner.
Jethro at once brought him out ; and
gave public notice that whosoever would
come and root out the rod that was
planted and growing in his garden, to
him would he give his daughter Zip-
porah to wife. Many came, small and
great, kings, princes, great men, and
men of valour, but could not root it up.
But Moses, while walking in Jethro's
garden, saw that rod of sapphire (or
diamond) vbv pIpH E?-1*l2»n CW,
with the glorious name of Jehovah,
engraved on it. He then rooted it up
thence, at once, and it became a rod in
his hand ; and he returned home with
it in his hand. Jethro seeing this,
marvelled much, and gave his daughter
Zipporah to wife unto Moses, etc.
[Another story says that the inscrip-
tion on that rod was the initials of the
ten plagues of Egypt.]

But in the Debvritho of Mar Salo-
mon of Botsra, c. xvii, we are told that
Adam's stick was a branch of the tree
of the knowledge of good and evil,
which he broke (or cut) off the tree as
he was leaving the Garden of Eden.
(Assem, Bibl. Or., vol. ill, p. 212.)

31 The Talmud and Josephus, as we
have seen, teach that at first all animals
had speech ; and Philo (Qucest. xxxii,
Armen, in Gen.) is of opinion that " in
the beginning of the existence of the
world, all animals (or living creatures)



wotch cmmam kol i panavoruthind, were
not altogether deprived of reasoning
power; although man excelled in this
respect and in a clearer voice." Thus
attributing a voice to the serpent, given
it at the time, in order to seduce Eve ;
which the gloss, however, says, ipr
shtchmamp, was only a hissing, under-
stood by Eve for what it meant.

32 Our father Adam wept before the
gates of Paradise, and the angels said
unto him, " What wilt thou that we do
to thee, Adam ?" He then answered,
" Behold, ye cast me out ; I therefore
intreat you to give me some sweet
spices from Paradise, that when I am
driven out of it, I may offer a sacrifice
to God, that He may hear me." Then
at the request of the angels, God gave
Adam leave to gather from the garden,
KpoKov Kai vdpSov Kal KctXa/jiov Kal
Kivufiiofiov Kai XoiTra air'ipnara tig
Siarpoipfiv avTov, saffron and spike-
nard, and sweet-cane and cinnamon,
and other seeds for his support. Having
gathered them, he left the garden and
dwelt in the land. ('ATroicaXw^tff in
Vita Adce et E., p. 67.)

33 " Nam et Magos reges fere habuit

{Adv. Marc, c. xiii) " reges, dixit topar-

We read in the History of Georgia
{Ka/rt'hUs tskhovreha, ch. x, p. 39), that
in the first year of king Aderki, ishwa

Jesus Christ was bom in Bethlehem of

him presents. Then news came to
Mtzkhet'ha — the capital of Georgia at
that time — about this coming of the
Magi, " that an army was come to
destroy Jerusalem." This caused great

wailing among the Jews of the place,
until the year after, other news was
brought that " the army was not come
to destroy the Holy City, but had with
them presents they brought and offered
to a certain male child, respecting his
birth. This caused great joy among
the Jews ; until some fourteen years
later, a certain disciple called Anna
came from Jerusalem, with other Jews
of Mtzkhet'ha, and told the people that
the child, to whom Magi had offered
gifts, was now grown up, and called
Himself the Son of God, and pro-
claimed a new law and service," etc.

saying he waa a prophet-apostle for the
moon, and called men to the worship
of the moon ; and that D^"!!!!!! ^^ W^
niaiSn minjya there are books
of his extant on the tillage of the
land. They say of Adam, moreover,
that when he came from the [climate]
land of CStrn [Tasom, or Tasham],
near India, and dwelt in the land of
Babylon, he brought with him wonder-
ful things ; among others, a tree of
gold that yielded branches, leaves, and
flowers [of gold] ; also a like tree of
Btone, with leaves that fire could not
burn, and that could shelter 10,000 men
as tall as Adam. And he brought with
him two leaves, each of which could
cover two men. But they also say that
Seth departed from Adam's worship of
the moon, etc. {More Nevukim, sect, iii,
ch. 29.)

They also say that Adam relates in
his book on the tillage of land, that
there is in India a tree, whose branches,
when thrown upon the ground, wriggle
and creep like a serpent, etc. (Ibid.)

39 In Targum Jonathan, however, we
read that God made for Adam and Eve
"*P"**1 1"'^"'^'' robes of honour of the
skin of the serpent, which it had
sloughed off ; and God covered their
skin withal, instead of their own beauty
of which they were stripped. (In Gen., iii.)

40 Si cui igitur eorum, qui certant
vel lumen, vel figura quaepiam ad
similitndinem ignis appareat, ne am-
plectatur hujusmodi visum ; est enim
fallacia inimici manifesta; quae quidem
res multos fefellit, qui propter ignoran-
tiam, a via virtutis deflexerunt. Nos
antem scimus quod quamdiu sumus in
hac mortali vita, aliquid coelestium
miraculorum ejus videre aspectn cor-
poris non possumus. ( B. Diadochns, de
perfect. spiritiuiU, c. xxxvi.)

41 Before the law fell on Adam [doom,
after his transgression] he ate no food ;
but after the law had fallen on him, he



and his family [Abel was bom to him
before the fall, II, p. 122] arose, and
ate of all the fruits, vegetables, and
living things Fetahil had prepared for
him. {Cod. TVosor. ii, p. 134.)

42 This account agrees with that of
Abul-pharaj or Bar. Hebrsens {Dyn.
Arab., p. 6 ; Chron. Syr., p. 3), who calls
Cain's sister Climia, and Abel's Lebada.
Arab writers on the Coran, however,
say that Eve always brought forth twins;
a boy and a girl (Maracci, sur. v) ;
while Sidra V Adam {Codex Nasar.) of
the Mandasans (ed. Norberg ii, p. 120,
sq.), says that after Fetahil had created
the world and Adam and Eve, to whom
he gave feet to walk and a mouth to
speak, he made for Adam a son like
unto himself — pure and sinless, called
Abel ; before Abel the son of Eve.
But after Adam and Eve had returned^
to the land (Elda) in which they had
been created, Eve brought forth twins,
son and daughter, three years following,
etc. According to the Kufale (p. 16),
however, Cain was born in the third
week (of years) of the second Jubilee
(seventieth year from creation, Syncell.),
Abel in the fourth ; and his sister Awan
(Aswam, Asauna, Syncell.) in the fifth.
But according to Methodius (Bar. Hebr.,
Syr.) called Mar Thudiusi in Arabic,
(Dyn., p. 6), Cain and Climia were born
thirty years after Adam and Eve came
cat of the garden ; Abel and Lebuda
thirty years later. It was seventy years
after, that Adam wishing to marry them
one to another, Cain slew his brother.

Targ. Onkelos in Gen. iv, 2, renders
the Hebrew text correctly ; but Targ.
Jonathan, says that after the birth
of Cain, Eve brought forth his twin
sister and Abel — although it is not
easy to understand how that could be.

Eve, says S. Ibn-Batrik (Eutychus),
conceived and brought forth a son called
Cain and a daughter called Azrun.
Then she conceived again and gave

birth to a son called Abel, and to a
daughter called Awain, bat in Greek,
Laphura. (Nazam al-j., p. 14.)

43 Or, grudged it. " He," says Philo
on this, " who slays a victim [or, sacri-
fice], after dividing it, pours out the
blood about the altar, and takes home
the meat. But he who brings an
offering, gives it whole, as we see, to
him who takes [or, receives] it. Thus
he who is selfish [a lover of self] like
Cain, parts or divides [his offering] ;
but he, who like Abel, is a lover of God,
devotes [to Him] his gift." (^Qwcest. in
Oen., Armen. Ixii.)

44 According to Said Ibn-Batrik
(Eutychus) when the sons were grown
up, Adam said to Eve : " Let Cain take
Owain, that was born with Abel, and
let Abel take Azrun who was bom with
Cain." Then, said Cain to Eve his
mother, " I will take my sister, and Abel
shall take his sister; because Azrun
was fairer than Owain." But when
Adam heard these words, he was greatly
perplexed, and said to Cain : " It is
against the commandment that thou
shouldest marry the sister that was born
with thee." (^Nazam al-j., pp. 14-17.)

According to S. Epiphanius, Hoeres.xl,
5, the Archontici, heretics in Palestine,
held that o SidjSoXoQ iXQuty irpbg rryv
'Evav, <TvvT}<p9t) aury wg dvijp ywvancj,
Kai iyivvtfffev l^ airov tov n K«tV teat
rbv *A/3«\ — and that the two brothers
did not fall out on account of God's
preference for Abel, but because they
both wished to have the same sister in
marriage. Therefore did Cain kill Abel.
For a Gnostic account of this, see S.
Irenaeus, Hoeres, lib. i, p. 110 (ed.
Grabe) ; concerning which statements
Theodoritus says (Haires, lib. i, 11),
" were I to repeat them koivuivhv rffQ
ipXvapiaQ vTriXajSov,! might be thought
to share in their folly."

45 Why then did Cain and Abel
quarrel together? Because, answers



E. Arona, the fairest twin sister was
bom with Abel. Cain, then said, " I shall
take her to wife because I am the eldest."
But Abel said : " But I will have her
because she was bom with me." (^Beresh.
Kabbah, sect, xxii, fol. 26.)

Said Ibn-Batrik relates that Adam
then said to Cain and to Abel, " Take ye of
the fruits of the earth, and of the young
of your flock, and go to the top of that
holy mountain, and make an offering
there; and then take your wives to
yourselves." Cain offered of the best
fruits of the earth ; and Abel of the best
of his flock. Meanwhile, as they were
going up the mountain, Satan entered
(the heart) of Cain to kill his brother
because of Azrun his sister. Therefore
God did not accept Cain's offering.
(_Nazam al-j., p. 17.)

This is contrary to Scripture. Tar-
gum Onkelos, renders the Hebrew ; but
Targum Jonathan says, that "Cain
and Abel made their offering on the
fourteenth of Nisan, and that Cain's
offering was MirT'D 3?"nQ of flax-
seed." Gen. iv, 2, sq. Or, according
to Bk, Zoar, quoted in Yalk. Bubeni,
fol. 21, Cain's offering was of^Htt^D
flax, his thoughts dwelling on covering
his nakedness from before the Lord.

Josephus (Antiq. i, c. 2) says, Abel
offered ydXa, Kai rd jrpwroronca tuv
fioaKtjjinTuv milk, and the firstlings of
his flock.

46 God said to Cain, " "Why is thy
countenance sad ? If thou doest well,
•hall not thy guilt be forgiven thee ?
But if thou doest evil in this life, thy
sin shall be reserved unto the great day
of Judgment, and thy sin shall lie at
the door of thy heart. Behold, I have

pnrity (or, holiness) and between sin].
(Targ. Jonathan in Gen. iv.)

47 Then Cain said to Abel, " Let us go
down into the Tale." Hence we see
either that they were living on the slope
of the mountain of Paradise, whence
Cain led his brother into the plain
below, or that Abel was tending his
sheep on the hill, whence Cain brought
him down into the vale, suited to him
by reason of the standing corn and
mud ; among which Cain could easily
hide and bury his brother. (S. Ephrem,
in Gen., vol. i, p. 41.)

48 Cain said to Abel his brother. Let
us go into the field. When there Cain
said, " There is no judgment ; there is
no Judge ; there is no world to come,
and there is neither reward for the
righteous nor retribution to the wicked."
But Abel replied, " There is a Judgment
and there is a Judge ; there is a world
to come, and there is both a reward to
the righteous, and a punishment to the
wicked." And as they were disputing
about this in the field, Cain rose against
his brother, stuck a stone into his
forehead and killed him. (Targ. Jonath.
and Jer., in Gen. iv.)

49 Josephus (Antiq. i, c. 2) says, that
Cain Tov VEKpbv avrov iroltjaaQ Supavij
Xijtrtiv virkXajiiv ; and S. Ephrem as
stated above, says that as Abel tended
his sheep on a hill, Cain allured him
into the plain, where he might easily
hide his body among the tall ears of
com, and i^medro thamre hico, and
cover it with mud. But in the Coran
(sur. v, 37) we read : faba'ath alldhu
ghuraban ydbhathu fi-llardh, that God
sent a raven that scratched the earth to
show Cain how to hide his brother's
corpse. Jelal, however (Maracci, p. 229)
says that this raven had a dead one in
its beak, which it hid in the earth after
having dug it with its beak and claws.
But Masudi (ch. iii, p. 64) says that
God sent forth two ravens, one of which



killed and bnried the other. Seeing
this, Cain repeated the words of the
Corcm, sur. v, 34 : " Wretched man that
I am, why cannot I be like this raven
and hide my [shame or] guilt against
my brother ?" He then buried him.

Mid/rash Tankhuma (p. 6, ed. Amst.)
however, says that they were m3")3y
D'*"nniS two clean birds, one of which
killed its fellow, then dug the earth
with its feet and buried it, in the
presence of Cain, and in order to show
him how to bury his brother, and to
hide his blood.

R. Eliezer (Pvrke, etc.), however,
as quoted in Yalkut Shimoni, fol. ii,
says that, the Itt'^a nMQ? dh^n
bnn bW l3S!i dog who kept Abel's
sheep, watched by his corpse to ward off
beasts and birds of prey from it, And
that as Adam and his help-meet sat by
the corpse, wailing aloud over their
son who lay dead, not knowing what to
do, a raven that had killed its fellow
said to them, " I will show you what to
do." It then began to dig in the earth,
and buried the bird. Then Adam said
to Eve, " Let us do the same ; " and
they dug the earth, and buried Abel.

I, Enoch, came to a place where I
saw the spirits of the departed ; and I
asked Raphael who was with me, " What
spirit is it whose voice reaches me and
accuses ? " And Raphael answered: " It
is the spirit of Abel, whom Cain his
brother killed ; and who will accuse him
until his seed is destroyed from off the
face of the earth, and from the race of
men his seed defiles." I then asked
Raphael about him and about the day
of judgment, and why he was separated
from the rest [or one from another].
Then he answered : " These three separa-
tions, by chasm, water and light above,
have been made between the spirits of
righteoas men, from sinners — when they
are buried in the earth ; and great is
the suffering of sinful spirits, until the

Enoch, c. xxii, p. 14, 15.)

Before Caia had killed his brother,
the land yielded fruit like the Garden
of Eden; but after that murder, the



land turned to yield only thoma and
thistles. (Targ. Hieros. in Gen. Iv.)

this sign was «n^p>T «ni SQtt? of the

NOTES TO BOOK II.



1 Masndi (i, cli. ill, p. 65), gives a
popular ditty said to have been com-
posed by Adam, while mourning for
Abel. " How changed is the land and
those who dwell in it 1 The face of the
earth is now but hideous dust ; Every-
thing has lost both flavour and colour ;
Mirth and gladsome faces are gone ;
And our family has taken the tama-
risk and other weeds, for the sweet and
lovely plants of Paradise. Around us
[watches] a relentless foe, accursed, at
whose death we should breathe freely.
Cain has slain Abel cruelly [or with
violence] ; Oh, sorrow — over that beau-
tiful countenance I How should I not
shed floods of tears, while the grave
embraces Abel ? There is now for me
but a life-long sorrow; for what relief
could I find from it ? "

To which Eblis, who was at hand,
though unseen replied : —

" Go from this land, and from its
inhabitants, for the earth is now too
narrow for thee. Thou, Adam wast in
it with thy wife Eve, happy at being
safe from the woes of this world ; But
my wiles and my craft rested not, until
thou wast deprived of those goods. And
unless the mercy of the Most High pro-
tected thee, the wind alone would carry
thee far from the everlasting Paradise."



See Fabricius Cod. Apoc. V. T., vol. i,
p. 21, sq., for " The Psalms of Adam
and Eve."

2 R. Abarbanel, Comm. in Pent.
p. 30, says that Eve conceived twins in
the Garden of Eden ; and that what is
told in the Midrash is true, that she
must have brought forth twins [though
not so stated in Scripture], otherwise
Cain could not have taken a wife, and
have had children by her, whose name
was Ana, etc.

3 When Eve conceived Seth, her
forehead shone, light brightened up her
features, and her eyes flashed rays of
light; and when the time came that she
should be delivered, she brought forth
Sheit [Seth] an eagle among men, who
excelled them in grace, beauty of form,
perfection of gifts, nobleness of dis-
position; and resplendent of light which,
passing from Eve into him, shone on
his forehead, and enhanced his beauty ;
so that Adam called him Hibbet Allah,
" Gift of God." When Seth was grown
up, Adam taught him his high calling
as depository of God's will concerning
his race, etc. etc. — Masudi i, ch. iii, pp.
67, 68.

In the two hundredth year of Adam,
says Syncellus, Seth was taken up by
angels and taught the falling away of

the Watchers, the destrnction of the
earth by the Flood, and the coming of
the Saviour, "When after forty days*
absence he returned among men, he
then declared to Adam and Eve what
he had seen and heard, etc. Seth was
then forty years old; he was beautifully
formed, as all his children were after
him. They dwelt in a high land not far
from Eden, etc. (Ch/ron. p. 16, 17; and
Cedren. Hist, Comp. i, p. 16.)

Adam when two hundred and thirty
years old, begat a son whom he called
Seth, of a beautiful countenance, tall,
and of a perfect stature like his father
Adam. (Said Ibn-Bat. Nazam al-j.,
p. 17.)

4 Adam knowing in his own vnsdom
that this son would not, like Abel, seek
after glory and kingdom, and that he
would not be like Cain, eager after
possessions, and a tiller of the ground —
but that he would give himself to
spiritual and intellectual pursuits —
called him HW, Seth, because nHHW
ub^Vn nnWV l^natr? he saw that
the world would be founded on him.
(K. Abarbanel, Comtn. in Pent, fol. 31.)

Seth was weaned when twelve years
old, says Cedrenos {Hist. Comp. i, p.
16) ; and his face shone so brightly
that they called him a god !

5 This chapter looks like a Christian
version of the story of Lilith (rT^b^b),
a night owl, but also "lamia," a she
devil, often mentioned in Rabbinical
writings. Elias Levita (TisKbi, ed. Isn.,
sn. 6, v), says, " one finds written that
during the one hundred and thirty
years Adam was separated from Eve,
demons (D**"?!!?) visited him, con-
ceived and bare him demons, unclean



spirits and wicked sprites ()''p'*TlD)."
And R. Eliezer adds, " When God created
the first man alone, He said, ' It is not
good for man to be alone.* He created
for him a woman out of the earth whom
He called Lilith, who bare him every
day a hundred children, that were dis-
persed abi'oad among the lands, seas,
mountains," etc. ( Ben Syra in Buxtorf ,
Lex. V, p. 114, 8. 1.)

And elsewhere we are told in agree-
ment with such stories, that "Adam
was driven from Paradise on the Sab-
bath-eve, down into the lowest of the
seven earths (n^innnn V''^) where
he spent the whole Sabbath in terror and
in utter darkness. But when he had re-
pented of his sin God brought him up to
(nDTS) the ground above that, where
alight lighted the firmament of heaven,
etc. As regards the inhabitants of that
earth (Adamah) they are all Anakim of
immense size, which the first man begat
together with demons, spirits and
Liliths O'^b'^b) which Lilith bare unto
him, when she overcame him against
his will, during the one hundred and
thirty years he was separated from Eve,"
etc. ('Eweg hammelek, fol. 179, quoted
in Eisenmeng., vol. i, p. 459.)

7 " When Adam's death," says Eu-
tychus, "drew near, he called his son
Seth, Enos, the son of Seth, Cainan,
the son of Enos, and Mahalaleel, the
son of Cainan, and commanded them
saying, ' Let this commandment be
to your children. When I am dead
embalm my body with myrrh, incense
and cassia [or, cinnamon] and lay
me in the Cave of Treasures. And
whichever of your sons is living at the
time of your leaving the borders of the
garden (Paradise), let him take my
body with him, and place it in the
middle of the earth ; for from thence
will come my salvation and that of all
my children.' " (Nozam al-j., p. 18.)

Adam, the first man created, having
heard John discoursing of Christ in the
region of darkness, said to Seth his
son, " O my son, I desire thee to tell the
ancestors of our race and the prophets,
whither I send thee, when I fell sick unto
death." Then Seth said, "Patriarchs
and prophets hearken. My father Adam
when he fell sick unto death, sent me to
make a request unto God, close to the



gates of Paradise, that He would guide
me through the leading of an angel, to
the Tree of Mercy (that is, of the oil
of mercy) that I take some of the oil,
and anoint my father, and raise him
from his sickness. That, I have done.

"Then, after my prayer, the angel of
the Lord coming to me, said, What is
thy request, O Seth ? Thou askest for
the oil that raises the sick, or for the
tree whence that oil flows, for thy
father's sickness. Thou canst not find
it now. Gro thy way, and tell thy father,
that when five thousand five hundred
years from the creation shall be fulfilled,
the Only Begotten Son of God, shall
come upon earth in a human body, and
that He will anoint him with that oil ;
and that He will wash him and his
children (Trkvvtt) with water and with
the Holy Ghost ; and that thy father
will then be cured of every disease.
For the present, this is impossible. The
patriarchs and prophets hearing this,
rejoiced greatly," (Evangel. Nicodemi
Griec^, c xix, ed. Thilo.) The Latin
copy, as given by Fabricius, Cod. Apoer.
V. T., vol. i, p. 278, which is followed
by the A.-Saxon version (ed. Thwaites,
Oxon, 1698) differs from the Greek in
some respects. See also Cotel. Pat.
Apost. vol. i, p. 497, note,

8 Adam having in the six hundredth
year, repented of his transgression,
received by revelation through Uriel,
who is set over those who repent, — a
knowledge of the Watchers, of the Flood,
and of other things to come. (Sync.
Chron., p,l8,) He died aged nine hundred
and thirty, on the same day as that on
which he had transgressed. Inasmuch
as one thousand years are as one day
among heavenly witnesses, as it was
written on the Tree of Knowledge that
he should die on the day he ate of its
fruit, Adam did not complete the day of
one thousand years, by seventy years,
but died on that same day. {Kujale,

p. 19.) Adam also learnt of Uriel abont
the prayers sent np on high, day and
night, by the whole creation, through
Uriel who presides over repentance. At
the first hour of the day — prayer in
heaven ; second hour — prayer of angels ;
third hour — of birds ; fourth hour — of
cattle ; fifth hour — of wild beasts ;
sixth hour — angels attend, and set in
order the whole creation ; seventh hour
— angels go into the presence of God,
and come out thence ; eighth hour —
praises and offerings of angels ; ninth
hour — prayers and supplications of men ;
tenth hour — prayers of heavenly and
earthly beings ; eleventh hour — con-
fession and rejoicings of all ; twelfth
hour — men's intercessions accepted by
God. (Cedren. Hist. Comp., p. 18; and
M. Glycas, AutmI., p. 228; also Fabi-ic,
Cod. Apoc. V. T., vol. i, p. 14, sq.)

9 After Seth, Adam begat nine
more children. (^Kufale, p. 16.) And
when he died he left thirty-three sons
and twenty-six daughters ; having been
chief of his kindred all the days of his
life. (Syncell. Chron., p. 19.)

10 All the time Adam lived, says
Said Ibn-Batrik (Eutyclius), was nine
hundred and thirty years. He died on
a Friday, in the fourteenth night from
the new moon, being the sixth of Nisan,
which is Barmudeh, at the ninth hour
of that Friday. That is the hour at
which he was driven from Paradise.
When Adam was dead, his son Seth
embalmed him, as he had commanded
him. And Seth took his body up the
mountain, and buried it in the Cave of
Treasures. And they mourned over
him forty days. {Nazam al-j., p. 18.)

Et sicut prsedixit Michael archan-
gelus, post sex dies venit mors Ada;.
Cum cognovisset Adam, quia hora venit
mortis suse, dixit ad omnes filios suos,
Ecce sum annorum dccccxxx, et si
mortuue f uero, sepelite me contra ortum
del magnum habitatiouibus. Et fac-



tnm est eum finisset omnes sermones
illius, tradidit spiritum. Et videt Seth
manum domini extensam tenentem
Adam. Et scpelierunt Adam et Abel,
Michael et Urihel angeli in partibus
paradisi, videntibns Seth et matro
ejus et alio nemine. (Fito Adce et JS.,
pp. 58 and 66.)

1 1 The Life [He who is Life — eternal
life, also called Supreme Life, as dis-
tinguished from the second or lesser
life — that of mortals], the Supreme
Life having taken counsel, sent deliver-
ance to Adam, from his body, and from
this world of sorrow. Then his soul
was severed from the body, to which it
said, " Why do we tarry, in this foul
body ? The Deliverer will come and
set us free." Then the Deliverer came
— touched Adam, and said to him :
" Arise, O Adam, shake off thy foul
body, house of clay, which the seven
star-angels made for thee ; the Life
sends me to fetch thee back to the place
whence thou camest, where thy parents
live." Hearing this, Adam began to
weep, and said : " My father, if I go
with thee, who will take care of this
world — of Eve my wife — of the crops
I have sown — of this house which I
occupied — of the fruits of my garden ?
Who will draw water from the Eu-
phrates and from tlxe Tigris to water
my plants ? Who will bind the ox to
the plough — put the seed in the earth —
and gather in the harvest ? Who will
befriend the orphan and the widow,
clothe the naked, and set free the cap-
tive ? "

" Come, come," said the Deliverer to
Adam ; " come, and put on thy garment
of light, where the sun never sets ;
wear on thy brow the crown of glory ;
gird thyself with water wherein is no
pain, and sit on the throne, made ready
for thee by the Eternal Life," etc. "But
Father," said Adam, "if I go with Thee
who will take care of my body — wake

eat, or shelter it from the storm — or keep
the beasts of the field from devouring
it, or the birds of the air from nestling
themselves in the hair of my head," etc.,
etc. {Cod. Nasar., pp. 140-142.)

12 Then the Messenger of Life came,
took Eve away from an evil crowd, and
put an end to her sorrow. She then
fell upon her face before him and said,
" Welcome art thou, O Lord; take me to
Thy company above, and bring my soul
oat of this body." " I am come," said
the Messenger of Life, " to fetch thee —
thou shalt rest in light, and thy counten-
ance shall shine for ever," etc. (Cod.
Nazar., iii, p. 166, sq.)

Post sex dies vero quod mortuus est
Adam, cognoscens Eva mortem snam,
congregavit omnes filios suos et filiaa
suas, qui f uerunt Seth cum xxx fratribus
et xxx sororibus, et dixit eis Eva : Au-
dite me filii mei — dixit nobis Michael
archangelus : propter prsevaricationes
vestras generi vestro superinducet domi-
nus noster warn jvdicii sui primum
per aquam, secundum per ignem; his

num genus.

cabit genus nostrum, tabulae de terra
solrentur et tabulae lapideae permane-
bnnt si autem per ignem judicabit genus
nostrum, tabulae lapideae solventur, et
de terra Inteae decoquentur. Haec
omnia cum dixisset Eva filiis suis
tradidit spiritum. Postea cum magno
fletu sepelierunt cam — et cum essent
lugentes quattuor dies tunc apparuit eis
Michael archangelus dicens ad Seth :
homo Dei, ne amplius lugeas mortuos
tuos quara sex dies, quia septimo die
signum resurrectionis est futuri seculi
requies. — Tunc Seth fecit tabulas. ( Vita
AdcB et K, pp. 58, 59, 66.)



13 After the death of Adam, the
family of Seth severed itself from the
family of Cain the accursed. For Seth,
taking with him his firstborn son Enos,
with Cainan the son of Enos, and Maha-
laleel the son of Cainan, with their wives
and children, led them up the mountain
to the top, where he buried Adam. But
Cain and all his children abode in the
vale, where he had slain Abel. (Euty-
chus, Nazam al-j., pp. 20, 21.)

But Cain, after many wanderings
etc Toirov rivet Ka'ivav dvo[ia!^6fiivov
»/X0e, came to a certain place called
Cainan, where he committed all manner
of crimes, laying wait for way-faring
men and putting them to death, and
heaping up wealth untold from his
spoils of them. (S. Eustath. Antioch, in
Hexaemeron, fol. 749, ed. M.)

14 The children of Seth lived on that
mountain in the practice of purity [or,
of innocence], and were in the habit of
hearing the voices of angels, from whom
they were not far apart, and with whom
they joined in worshipping and praising
God; and they, with their wives and
children were called " Sons of God."
They did no work, neither sowed nor
reaped ; but their food was fruits of
trees. There was among them neither
envy, injustice, nor lying ; and their
bond (pledge or faith— iman/iMW*) was,
"No, by the blood of Abel." They
went up to the top of the Holy mountain
every day, and worshipped before God,
and blessed themselves in the body of
Adam. (Said IhD-B&t.,Nazamal-j.,Tp.^l.)

15 Then when the death of Seth drew
near, he adjured his children by the
blood of Abel, that not one of them
should go down from this holy moun-
tain, and not to let one of their children
go down to the children of Cain the
accursed. All the time Seth lived was
nine hundred and twelve years. (Said
Ibn-B., Nazam al-j., p. 21.)

opinion ; for he says not only that in
the days of Enos men went far astray
and the mind of thought of wise men
became stupified, but that tt?13MT
D'>3?"ll3n ]» in!53y Enos himself was
among those who erred. [This, too, is
far fix)m Philo's distinction between
Adam and Enos. Qucest. Armen. in
Cren.] And the error, says Maimo-
nides, was this, that they worshipped
and honoured the heavenly bodies and
built temples to them on high places,
etc. [R. Maimonides seems to take
Gen, iv, 26, " n Vnpb bmn TN as
other Hebrews do, to mean — then was
the calling on the name of God profaned
—and Targ. Onkelos n«b2jba ibn
" 2 men fell away from praying in
the name of the Lord. Targ. Jonathan,
" That was the age in whose days, men
began to go astray, who made to them-
selves idols, and called them by the
name of the Lord." But the LXX
read : 'Evwf, ovTog ■^XTritrtv IkikoX-
fiaOat TO ovofta Kvpiov tov &iov.']
(R. Maimonides, Halekot 'Avod. fcoJcav,
etc. 0pp., vol. i, fol. ed. Amst.)

R. Abarbanel, however, Comm. in Pent.,
fol. 31, understands it to mean that
in the days of Enos they began to pray
in the name of God in all their works,
becaupe until then, Adam, Abel, and

Set Vwn ms^sisn D"'-irt£?» vn

lived in intercourse with God who was
present among them.

17 Cain, says Geo. Syncellus ( C/iron.,
p. 19), died the same year as Adam
(a.m. 930), killed by the stones of his
house that fell upon him, Xidoic ydp Kai
avTOQ TOV 'Aj3f\ avtiXt — for himself
had killed Abel with stones. The
Kufale, whence this account is taken,
adds : " that he was thus killed by
righteous judgment ; for it is decreed
on the tables of heaven, that with what
weapon a man slays another, with such
also shall he be slain." (Kufale, p. 19,
20.) Cedrenas quotes this legend from



the mane source, at p. 16 of his Hist.
Compendium, where he also says, that
Abel having been righteous, his body
a(pavic ytyovevai, disappeared [from
the sight of man] in order to give those
who came after him a good hope [of
everlasting life].

18 Here follows in the Ethiopictext :
"Then Lamech stood [or, remained]
grieved for what he had done ; the
cattle went away from him into the
open country, and he knew not what to
do. But the narrative would be long
[or, tedious]." Yet the Arabic original
gives even a longer account, says Dr.
Trumpp in his note — that Lamech lay
there a long time, hungry and thirsty,
not knowing whither to go, blind as he
was. Then all his people turned out
to look for him over hill and down
dale ; and at last found him lying on
the ground, by the side of the two
corpses ; himself half-dead from hunger
and thirst. So they brought him home;
gathered the cattle together, and having
covered Cain and the young shepherd
in gay apparel, they buried them in
the neighbourhood, as being the first
of the Cainites that had died, and they
mourned over them forty days and forty
nights. Here, however, the Arabic adds
also, "But the story would be [too]
long."

In the three hundredth year of Enos,
Cain the accursed, Adam's son, who
had slain his brother Abel, was him-
self slain. For a seventh descendant
from Cain, called Lamech who was a
shepherd, shooting an arrow in play, hit
his ancestor Cain through the heart
and killed him. For Cain was bewildered
and wandering in the open country,
not being able to rest in any one place.
(Eutych. Nazam al-j., p. 22.)

R. S. .Tarchi, in his Comm. on
Gen. iv, 23, relates this story thus :
" Lamech's wives had separated them-
selves from him, for his having slain

Cain, and Tabal-Cain bis son. For
Lamech was blind, and was led about
by Tubal-Cain, who seeing Cain coming
and looking like a wild beast, told
Lamech his father, to bend his bow,
wherewith he killed Cain. When
Lamech fonnd that it was Cain his
ancestor, he struck his hands together ;
but Tnbal-Cain's head happening to be
between them, he also was killed by
Lamech. On this account did Lamech 's
wives leave him. But he quieted them,
saying, ' Hear ye my voice,' " etc.
(Comm. ad l, fol. 7, ed. Buxtf.) [The
same story is also told in Sepher
ayasha/r, Shalsheleth akkabbafa, etc.
See Kisenm. Ent. Jud.,\o\. i,p.471.]

Cedrenus and S. Ephrem (in Gen.,
vol. i, pp. 45 and 143) relate two
traditions, in substance like the above
account. It is also given in the Ar-
menian Desidhyun badmuthyants Asdw.
Survey of the histories of the books of
Holy Scripture, vol. i, c. 2, p. 13, Cedrenus,
however, gives another version of the
story, and says " that Lamech committed
two murders — of a man and of a child,
both of whom were brothers of Enoch,
who earnestly prayed God not to let
him see such slaughter, and for that, was
taken up into heaven." {H. Comp., p. 15.)

Mid/rash Tankhuma (fol. 6) tells the
story pretty much as it is in the
Ethiopic ; but adds that the little boy
said to Lamech, "I see JT^n yT2^
something like a wild beast." Lamech
shot an arrow and killed it. Then the boy
seeing Cain with a horn on his forehead,
lying dead, said, " O father, this beast is
like a man with a horn on the forehead 1"
Then Lamech clapped his hands together,
and so doing, killed the boy. He then
went home and said to his wives, " I have
slain a man to my wounding, and a
young man to my hurt I" Adah and
Zillah then said, they would no longer
live with him ; so that Lamech had to
go with them to Adam for judgment



1 9 Joseph B. Gorion, being in a certain
island in the neighbourhood of India,
" found there men like women, who lived
on live fish, and who told him they had
in their island the sepulchre of a very
ancient king, called Hainan, son of
Enos, who lived betbre the Flood, and
ruled the whole world, spirits, demons,
etc In his wisdom he knew that God
would bring a flood [and overwhelm the
earth] in the days of Noah. Wherefore
he wrote what was to happen after him
on tables of stone ; and lo they are there;

nW D^m pN mmb and the
writing is in Hebrew. And he also
wrote therein that in his days the
ocean overwhelmed a third part of the
world ; and so it happened in the days
of Enos, the son of Seth, son of Adam
the first man." {Jos. B. Qorion, lib.
ii, c. 18.) There seems to be some
confusion between this legend and the
one told in a note on Cainan, son of Ar-
phaxad, to which the reader may refer.

20 When the death of Cainan drew
near, he called Mahalaleel and adjured
him by the blood of Abel, not to let
one of his children go down from the
mountain to the children of Cain the
accursed. All the days of Cainan
were nine hundred and ten. (Eutych.,
Nazam al-j. p. 22.)

21 This word is of Arabic origin, and
is either for the collect, pi. jinnun
genii, pi. of junnun, a demon, devil ;
or, it may stand for junnun, folly,
etc. Anyhow, the " j " being pronounced
and transcribed "g" by the Ethiopic
translator, shows that the work was
done not far from Egypt, where " j " is
pronounced " g " hard.

According to Targ. Jonathan, in
Gen. V, Lamech had three sons, Jabel
and Tubal, sons of Adah ; and Tubal-
Cain and his sister Na'amah, children
of Zillah. One account says that the
young shepherd slain by Lamech, was

[book



Zillah's son ; and that for that reason
she and Adah would no longer live with
him. Jenan or Genon, might then be
for Tubal-Cain.

22 Abulpharaj, however (l>yn. Arab.,
pp. 8, 9) says that, the daughters of
Cain were reported to have first made
instruments of music and sung to them :
wherefore a song is called quinto in
Syriac, and in Arabic qvmnah means
a singing girl.

Cain, says S. Eustath. Antioch (in
HexaetneroTi,) invented /if rpa Kai araO-
fjLovQ, Kai opovg, measures, weights and
the division of land, and the building
of cities.

23 Meanwhile the children of Cain
played on instruments of music, until
the sound and clamour of them, reached
unto the top of the Holy mountain.
Then a hundred men of the children of
Seth gathered together to go down to
the children of Cain the accursed.
Jared then adjured them by the blood
of Abel, not to go down from the Holy
mountain ; but they would not hearken
to him, and went down. And when
they were come down and saw the
daughters of Cain the accursed, those
sons of Seth committed adultery with
them, and perished in consequence. Of
these adulteries giants were bom.
(Eutych. Nazam al-j., pp. 25, 26.)

24 Then Enoch the scribe said to
the Watchers, who had left heaven, and
had defiled themselves with women,
after the manner of men : " I have
written your petition [to the Most
High], but in my vision I have seen
that it will not be granted you ; judg-
ment has been passed on you, and ye
shall not be. And from henceforth,
ye shall not go up into heaven, so long
as the world endures ; for it has been
decreed that ye shall be bound in the
earth, all the days of the world.

" But before this, ye shall behold the
destruction of your beloved children ;



ye shall not possess them, but they shall
fall before you by the sword. And ye
shall pray for them, bat your prayer
shall not be heard," etc. (Book of Enoch,
c. xii — xiv, pp. 7, 8, 9.)

It was in the four hundredth year of
Jared, that the Watchers [typ^yoptc]
went down the Holy mountain and
begat giants of the daughters of Cain.
These giants not only were of immense
size and awful to look at, and given to
all manner of wickedness, but they also
invented weapons of war, magic, dyeing
stuffs, musical instruments, etc., aa
taught by Azael, one of their chiefs.
But avToig dpaKovroirodag tivec Trpotr-
fiyoptvaav, some say they were dragons
(or, serpents) with feet ; because in
waging war against the children of
Seth who were above on the mountain,
they had to creep on their hands and
feet, lying flat on the ground, etc.
(Cedren. Hist. Comp., p. 18.)

25 But when the sons of Seth who
had gone down to the daughters of
Cain the accursed, wished to ascend
the Holy mountain, the stones of the
mountain were made fire, so that they
could find no means of again going up
the mountain. Then after these, com-
panies after companies went down from
the Holy mountain to the daughters
of Cain the accursed. (Eutych. Nazam
al-j., p. 26.)

26 E. Abarbanel (Qusest. vi, Comm.
in Pent., fol. 31 ) says that "sons of God,"
is explained to mean, kings, princes or
judges, skilled in knowledge and endued
with power— or men possessed of divine
knowledge ; and that the Nephilim
[said by some to be the same as the
Anakim] were so called from their
fall from heaven PD2) into sin, on
earth.

27 And it happened in a certain
year of this Jubilee (twenty-fifth) that
angels of God saw the daughters of
men that they were fair, and took them

to wives who bare them giants, etc.
{KuSale, c. v, p. 20.)

After the death of Adam, Seth ruled
the race of men then living. Then two
hundred of his children called Watchers,
in the one thousandth year of the world,
four hundredth of Jared, and seven
hundred and seventieth of Seth, having
gone astray went down from the moun-
tain, and took to themselves wives,
who bare them giants, as Scripture
says. As some doubt this, adds
Syncellus, I will bring proofs of it
from the Book of Enoch, Moses and
S. Peter the chief of the Apostles.
(C/iron., p. 19 ; Bar. Heir., pp, 4, 5 ;
Abulphar. Dyn, Arab., pp. 8.)

Concerning the Watchers (from the
Ethiopic Book of Enoch, sect, ii, c. 7).

" And it happened when the children
of men multiplied in those days, that
daughters were bom unto them fair
and beautiful. And angels, sons of
heaven saw them, and desiring them,
said among themselves : ' Come let us
choose for us wives from among the
daughters of men, and beget children
for ourselves.' Then Samyaza, chief
among them, said : ' I fear lest ye will
not do this thing, so that the whole
retribution of this sin fall upon me.'
And they all answered : ' We will swear
with an oath and bind one another with
curses, that we will not turn from this
deed, but do it amain.' They then
swore and bound themselves together
with curses, for this thing. And they
were two hundred. Then they came
down to Ardis, which is on the top of
Mount Hermon, and called it Hermon
by reason of the oaths and curses
wherewith they had bound themselves

names of their chiefs :

2. Urakibarameel. 6. Dan'el.

13. Zakebe.

" These were the captains of the two
hundred, and the rest were with them.
Every one chose a wife for himself,
who taught him sorcery, divination, etc ;
and they brought forth giants, whose
stature was three hundred cubits, and
who injured all creatures, devoured
men and committed such sins aa
reached unto heaven. Then Michael,
Raphael, Gabriel, Suryal, and Uriel
looking down upon the blood shed on
the earth, addressed the Most High, on
behalf of men, etc. (c. 8.)

*' These angels of God, with whom He
was angry, for their having thus fallen,
did the Lord command us, says the
Angel of the Face, to bind into the
depths of the earth until the Day of
Judgment." (Kufale, c. v, p. 21.)

And Syncellus adds from Zosimns
of Fanopolis, in his book Imuth — that
these fallen angels taught secret arts, and
that the first book on the subject was
called xrifitv, ivQiv nal i} Tixvr} x»?/*£'«
KaXtirai, whence the art is called
c?i€OTto=chemistry. {Chron., p. 24.)

28 But when the death of Jared drew
near, he called unto him his son Enoch
and Methuselah the son of Enoch, and
Lamech the son of Methuselah, and
Noah the son of Lamech, and said unto
them: " See that not one of yon go down
from this Holy mountain ; for your sons
have erred and have perished. And I
know that God, powerful and glorious,
will not leave you on this Holy mountain.
Therefore whosoever of you shall go out
of this place, let him take with him the
body of Adam, and these gifts, and
place them wherever God shall tell
him." And all the days Jared lived
was 962 years. He died when Noah

was 206 years old, on a Friday about
sunset, the third day of Adar, which is
Barmahat Then his son Methuselah,
Lamech and Noah embalmed him and
laid him in the Cave of Treasures,
and mourned for him forty days.
(Eutych. Nazam. alrj., pp. 29-32.)

29 Then the Most High spake and
sent Arsyalalyur to the son of Lamech,
and said unto him : " Tell (him) in My
Name : hide thyself. And reveal unto
him the destruction of all flesh by the
waters of the Flood, that will come over
all the earth, and destroy all that is in
it. And teach him how he may save
himself and establish his seed in the
whole earth."

Then He sent Raphael to bind Aza-
zeel in the lowest pit, until the Day of
Judgment ; Gabriel and Michael to
punish the wicked inhabitants of the
earth.-^Let all flesh perish. Then after
it has been cleansed, vines shall be
planted and bear fruit-^-Peace and
righteousness shall reign therein, and
all the sons of men shall be righteous,
and all nations shall bless Me and do
Me service, etc. {BooTc of Enoch, c. x,
p. 6, 6, 7.)

These are the names of the holy
angels who watch.

Uriel, one of the holy angels — over
thunder and terror.

Eaphael, one of the holy angels-
over the spirits of men.

Eaguel, one of the holy angels — over
the punishment (restraint) of the world
and luminaries.

Michael, one of the holy angels — over
the good done to men, gives orders to
the nations.

Sarakiel, one of the holy angels —
over the spirits of men, whose spirits
have transgressed.

Gabriel, one of the holy angels — over
Akist (?) Paradise and the Cherubim.
CBook of Enoch, c. xx, p. 1.3.)

30 According to Midrash Tankhuma,



fol. 6, ever since God's curse upon the
earth, on account of Adam's transgres-
sion, the ground never yielded the seed
sown ; but H^^H ^^I^T VH H^H
D"»2r')p ')"'~l!J"'p1 when they sowed
wheat they reaped thorns and thistles.
Therefore did Lamech say, Noah should
" comfort them concerning their work;"
for after Noah's birth they reaped what
they sowed; wheat if they sowed wheat,
barley if they sowed barley.

31 I Enoch, scribe of righteousness,
alone of all the children of men, have
seen a vision of the end of all things
(Booh of Enoch, c. xix, p. 13), and have
received a portion of everlasting life.
They were a hundred and three para-
bles which I took up to tell those who
dwell on the earth, (c. vi, p. 20.)

In the Coran, sur. xix, and elsewhere
Enoch is praised as Edris, the name
given him by Arabic writers. He is so
called probably from darasa Dm, on
account of his skill in writing and of
his learning. (See Hotting. Eist. Or.,
p. 31, sq.; and Maracci., .4Zcor., p. 435.)
Enoch was the first among men who
taught writing, science and vrisdom of
all sorts. He wrote about the signs of
heaven, years, months, etc., and gave
laws. He also received visions of all
that is to happen until the Day of
Judgment. (Kufale, c. iv, p. 17.)

The ancient Greeks, says Abulpharaj
{Byn. Arab., p. 9), thought Enoch was
Hermes Trismegistus, so called for the
three great sciences he taught concern-
ing the three qualities inherent in God :
(1) His existence ; (2) His wisdom ; and
(3) His eternal life. The Arabs call
him Edris. The Sabians say that he
got his wisdom from Agathodemon,
that is Setb, the son of Adam ; and
others think also that Esculapius vras a
disciple of his, who grieved so much at
Enoch's departure from this world, that
he raised a statue of him which was
worshipped after the Flood ! etc.

As to the Book of Enoch, that con-
tains Jade 14, 15, known to Syncellas
who gives extracts from it, and to
several of the Fathers, bnt lost sight
of for centaries — it was discovered by
Brace in Abyssinia, written in Ethiopic,
several copies of which he brought to
Europe. It consists in visions of Para-
dise, of the coming of the Beloved,
of the Flood, and of the end of the
world. It is fall of excellent sentiments
and pious lore, dating probably from a
little before the coming of Christ.

Enoch received thirty leaves of writ-
ing from heaven, as Adam had received
thirty-one and Seth twenty-nine. (Ma-
sadi i, c iii, p. 73.)

have written a thousand leaves on the
property of plants, climate, etc. (See
Quatremfere's Agricultvra NabathoBorum,
quoted in Chwolson's Die Ssabier, i,
pp. 706, 708.

32 I then inquired of the Angel of
Peace who was going about with me :
" For whom are the instruments I see
prepared?" And he said: "For the
host of Azazeel, to be delivered to the
[or, cast under] the lowest condemna-
tion — Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, and
Phanuel shall be strengthened at that
time — ^when the Lord of Spirits sends
forth chastisement — then shall the stores
of waters that are above the heavens
burst open, on the fountains of water
that are on the earth and under the
earth. Those waters shall then mix
together as it were in union, and
shall blot out all that is in the earth,
unto the borders of heaven. Thus
shall they be made to know the iniquity
they have committed in the earth ; and
thus shall they be punished." {Book of
Enoch, c. lix., p. 30.)

" And now Methuselah my son/' said



Enoch, " I have made known unto thee
all [that Uriel told me concerning the
seasons, days, years and stars of heaven].
Keep, O Methuselah my son, the books
of [me] thy father, that thou mayest
transmit them to generations in the
world. I have given wisdom to thee and
to thy children, and to the children
thou shalt have, that they may give it
to those that are to come for ever,
(c. Ixxxii, p. 57.)

" I have made known to thee, Methu-
selah my son, all that I saw before thy
birth; now listen to another vision I
have had. As I was in the house of
Mahalaleel, my father-in-law, I saw
heaven fall upon the earth. And as it
fell, the earth was suspended in a great
abyss, mountains upon mountains, hills
upon hills, great trees were VFrenched
off their roots [trunks] and were thrown
in a heap into the abyss. And I cried.
The earth is destroyed ! Mahalaleel
heard my cry. I told him the vision.
My son, said he, the earth will be
destroyed, in a great overthrow because
of the sins of men. Now then, arise,
and pray the Lord that a remnant be
left," etc. (c. Ixxxiii, pp. 59, 60.)

33 " And now, Methuselah my son,"
said Enoch, " call together all thy bro-
thers and all thy mother's sons — for a
voice calls me ; and my spirit vrithin
me is troubled, to make known unto
yon all that shall ever happen to you."
Then Methuselah brought them to
Enoch, who said to all his righteous
children : " Hear, O my children, the
words of your father — my beloved :
Love righteousness, and walk therein.
Approach not right [or, integrity] vrith
a double heart, and make no fellowship
with double-hearted men. But walk in
righteousness, O my children ; for it
will lead you in good paths. And let
righteousness be your companion. —
Hearken unto me, therefore, O my
children : Walk in the ways of right-

eonsness, and avoid those of violence ;
for those who walk therein shall perish
for ever." (Boofc of Enoch, xci, pp. 74,
76.)

34 "After that^I went up to hea-
ven," says Enoch, " and I saw the sons
of holy angels treading on flame of
fire, whose garments were white and
their faces brilliant like [hail] crystal.
And I saw two rivers of fire, like unto
hyacinth; and I then fell on my face
before the Lord of Spirits. But Michael
took me by the hand and raised me up.
— But I fell again on my face, my
flesh was dissolved, and my spirit was
changed ; and I cried with a loud voice
and great spirit, I blessed, and praised,
and extolled. And what I did was
acceptable to the Ancient of Days —
who came with Michael, Gabriel, Ra-
phael, and Fhauuel, and thousands of
angels — one of which came to me and



said: Thou art the son of a man, born
for righteousness ; righteousness has
rested on thee, and the righteousness of
the Ancient of Days shall not forsake
thee. And the angel said to me : He
will give thee peace in His name for
ever — and it shall be so unto thee for
ever and ever. — Thus shall be length of
days with this son of sons of men, and
peace shall be to the righteous ; His
right path shall be to them [to follow]
in the name of the Lord of Spirits, for
ever." (Book of Enoch, c. Ixxi, pp. 45,
46.)

Sed et Enoch sine circumcisions

NOTES TO BOOK III.



1 After a time, said Enoch, my son
Methuselah, took for his son Lamech,
a wife who bare him a son, whose body
was white like hoar-frost, and red like
the blossom of a rose; the hair of his
head was white as wool, and as long ;
he had beautiful eyes, that shone like
the sun, and lighted up the whole house,
•when he opened them. No sooner did
he leave the hands of the midwife,
than he began to speak to the Lord in
righteousness.

Then Lamech his father was afraid
of him, and running, came to his father
Methuselah, and said unto him: " A son
is bom unto me, strange and unlike
other children of men, but like a child
61 angels of heaven; his nature [crea-



tion] is different, and is not like us.
His eyes are like the rays [feet] of the
sun ; his countenance glorious ; and,
altogether, he looks as if not born of
me, but rather of angels ; and I am
afraid some wonder will be wrought on
the earth in his days. I beseech thee,
go and inquire of Enoch, who is in
heaven, concerning him."

Methuselah then came and found me
at the end of the earth, and told me
what had happened.

Then I, Enoch, said to him, that in
the days of that child a great flood
would destroy the earth, and all the
inhabitants thereof, except that one and
his three sons, whose children should
beget gianta, not spiritual, but carnal,

etc. And tell Laraech that his son's
name shall be Noah ; because he shall
be the one of yon that shall be left after
you, etc. (Book of Enoch, c. cv, p. 87,
88.) [Eth. nuah, long. The Hebrew
etymology is given further on.]

2 Noah was 600 years old, when
Methuselah died aged 969 years on a
Friday, about mid-day, the twenty-first
of Ilul, which is Thut. Then Noah
and Shem embalmed him and laid him
in the Cave of Treasures, and mourned
for him forty days. There was now no
one left on the Holy mountain, but only
Noah with his wife, whose name was
Haikal, daughter of Namusa, Enoch's
son, and his three sons, Shem, Ham,
and Japhet, with their wives, who
were of the daughters of Methuselah.
Shem's wife was called Salit ; Ham's
wife, Nahlat ; and Japhet's wife,
Arisisah.

But when iniquity increased on the
enrth through the intercourse of the
children of Seth with those of Cain the
accursed, and they committed all man-
ner of wickedness and took to all sorts
of amusements, God made known to
Noah, saying, I shall send the Flood
over the earth and destroy everything
in it. And He commanded Noah to
come down the Holy mountain, and to
build a ship, of square timber (some say
of the wood of the Indian plane-tree),
three hundred yards long, fifty broad,
and thirty high, lined with pitch and
bitumen both in and out, with three
stories ; the lower for four-footed
beasts, the middle for birds, and the
upper for himself and his family, with
a door [opening or window] on the
eastern side, with cisterns for water,
and places for food. (Eutych. Nasam
ol-j., pp. 34, 37.)

3 Philo, QucBst, c. ii, p. 6, Armen. in
Gen., compares the ark to the human
body, after whose pattern he thinks it
was made. It seems that both S. Augus-



tine (Contra. Faust, 1. xii, c. 39) and
S. Ambrose {Hexaemer. 1. vi. c. 9) were
of the same opinion, which they bor-
rowed from Philo.

4 And God commanded Noah to
make a bell (nagits, a flat piece of wood,
suspended and beaten with a wooden
clapper, commonly used in the east, to
call to prayer) three yards long, of the
wood of the Indian plane (saj), a yard
and a half broad, with a clapper of the
same wood. And that Noah should beat
it three times a day ; in the morning, to
gather men to their work ; again at
noon at the hour of dinner ; and again
in the evening, at the time of parting.
" And when they hear thee," said God
to Noah, " beating the bell, and they
ask thee saying: What is it thou art
doing ? Tell them, God is about to send
a flood." (Eutych. Nazam al-j., p. 73.)

It is evident that Eutychus borrowed
his information from the Arabic copy
of this book ; for he mentions the sdj
" Indian plane," or teak tree ; the wood
of which Noah is said to have built the
ark, because it does not rot [or, is not
attacked by worms], but is passed over
by the Ethiopic translator, who pro-
bably did not understand the term,
as suggested by Dr. Trumpp, for he
hereby rendered it " ebony."

Dionysins Bar Salibi in his Pushoqo
d'qv/rovo, or " Exposition of the Liturgy,"
ch. iv, asks whence comes noqusho, the
wooden clapper or bell beaten to call
people to church, or the small brass
bell rung, during the service : " We
answer," says he, " that it is written in
many histories, that when God com.
manded Noah to build the ark. He also
told him to make a bell ; which was
beaten in the morning to gather work-
men to their work at the ark ; then at .
noon, for them to enjoy their meal ;
and again in the evening, for them to
rest from their work." (Asseman, Bibl.
Or., vol. ii, p. 179.)

5 God raised Noah a preacher of
righteoasness in those days; whose words
were hard {i.e., as clear) as torches.
He said to them : " Bepent, or the
Flood will overwhelm you." But they
laughed at him — That old man of the
ark I and said : " A flood 1 whence will
it come ? If it is of fire, we have a
thing called THrbV, Alitha, that will
save us from it. If it is a flood of
waters, fi-om the earth, we have iron
plates [or, hoes] wherewith to dig ; and
if it comes from the heaven, we have a
thing called 31p27, a sponge, to soak it
up." Then he said to them : " It will
come from between the soles of your
feet." [With a play on ^pV or mp^?
a sponge, and Dpy sole or heel, of the
foot, etc.] Talmud Bab., Sanhedr., p.
216.

6 According to the Talmud and to
Jewish Rabbis, Og, king of Bashan,
was one of these giants who had escaped
drowning in the Flood, by being shut up
in a box with a unicorn, or by sitting
on the top of the ark, and fed by Noah.
(Targ. Jonathom in Gen. xiv.) Others
say he was the same Eliezer, Abraham's
servant, whom he used to cover with
the palm of his hand, etc. But in the
Targnm of Jonathan B. Uzziel, on
Numb, xxi, 36, we read that : Og seeing
the camp of the Israelites three miles
long, went and fetched a mountain of
that size, to throw it upon the camp.
Upon which the Word of God T> ]1D
sSnt 7"'113T prepared at once a snail
[or, worm] that ate a hole through the
mountain ; so that Og's head passed
through it [the mountain resting on
his shoulders]. He then tried to get it
out: but his teeth having grown on
each side of his month, he could not do
so. Moses then took a hatchet ten
cubits long, and smote him in the heel,
etc.

7 It is said in the Law that Sons
of God (called Beni Elohim), when



they looked upon the beautiful dangh>
ters of Cain, came down to them;
whence giants were bom. But he
errs, and knows not what he is saying,
who tells us that angels came down to
daughters of men (lit. of the flesh).
But they were the sons of Seth who
came down from the Holy mountain to
the daughters of Cain the accursed, for
the sons of Seth were called Beni
Elohim, or sons of God, by reason of
their purity, and so long as they dwelt
on the Holy mountain. They err then,
who say that angels came down to the
daughters of men (lit. of the flesh) ; for
the essence of angels is simple [or, single]
and their nature is in no need of
marriage. Man, however, is composite
in his nature, who requires marriage,
like other animals. If angels had inter-
course with daughters of men, not
one of them would remain a Tirgin.
(Eutych. Nazam al-j., p. 26.)

8 God commanded Noah to make a
ship, and when it was finished, Gabriel
brought the coffin containing the bones
of Adam, which was laid in the ark.
(Masudi i, ch. iii, p. 74.)

Eutychus puts the following words
in the mouth of Lamech, who, when
dying, in the five hundred and fifty-
ninth year of Noah, said unto him :
"God, the mighty and glorious, will
not leave thee on this mountain. W^hen,
therefore, thou shalt go down, take
with thee the body of Adam, and bring
with thee the three offerings, namely,
the gold, the myrrh, and the incense.
Then command thy son that after thy
death he take the body of our father
Adam, and lay it in the middle of the
earth.

" Then appoint from among thy
sons one man to minister there ; a man
devoted to God all the days of his life;
without a wife ; who shall shed no
blood, and bring no offering, neither
bird nor beast, but only bread and

vine ; for from thence shall come the
sal ration of Adam [or, of man]. His
raiment sliall be of the skin of wild
beasts ; he shall not shave his hair,
neither pare his nails ; but remain
alone ; for he shall be called priest
of God, that is, Melchizedec." After
giving these commandments to his son
Noah, Lamech died on a Sunday, at
snnset, the nineteenth of Adar, which
is Barmahat ; Noah then embalmed
him, and laid him in the Cave of
Treasures, and they mourned for him
forty days. (Entych. Nazam al-j., p.
33.)

9 The apocryphal history of Mel-
chizedec found among the writings of
S. Athanasius (vol. ii, p. 7, sq.) tells us
that "there was a queen of Salem whose
son was called Salaad." This Salaad had
a son called Melchi, and Melchi having
married a wife called Salem, had by her
two sons, Melchi and Melchizedec.

Melchizedec, who was an idolater,
was brought to the knowledge of the
true God, by beholding the starry
heavens and the works of nature. He
then renounced his idols ; and, leaving
his home to avoid the sacrifice of his
brother to the seven planets, went up
Mount Tabor, where he prayed God to
destroy all those who had slain and
sacrificed his brother to idols. Upon
this the earth suddenly opened, and
swallowed up the whole of Melchizedec's
family. Therefore is he said to be
airarotp, afiijrwp, ayiviaXoytfTog. He
then continued seven years to live in
a thick forest on Mount Tabor, almost
naked, until his back became tDcnl Sspfia
XtXiivijQ, like the back of a tortoise.

Then Abraham went to fetch him ;
pared his nails, and clothed him in
pontifical vestments. Melchizedec then
blessed Abraham, and gave him
vOTtjpiov aKparov Kal KXdtTfta aprov
Kai Tip Xaifi avrov rtti, a cup of pure
wine and a morsel of bread, to him and



to the three hundred and eighteen men
who were with him. This is the figure
of the holy Eucharist, and of the three
hundred and eighteen fathers assembled
at the Council of Nicasa. Melchizedec
also is taken for the Son of God, bnt
not tls Ttjv xapiv, as to spiritual
gifts.

Gregory of Dathev, a celebrated
Armenian divine of the fourteenth
century, seems to liave known this
tradition. In his book (Kvrk hartsmants,
c. xvii, p. 300, ed. Const.) he says :
"Melchizedec's father was called Melchi,
and his mother, Sala ; and they dwelt
at Salem. From his birth he was
consecrated to idols ; but he was
carried away by an angel to Mount
Tabor, and fed there, until he was
grown up. One day a cloud descended
upon the mountain, and a hand stretched
out of the cloud, ordained him priest
saying : " Melchizedec, without father,
mother or kindred, and like unto the
Son of God ; " because having been
taken from his parents when quite a
child, he had grown unlike them, not
knowing them, and unknown to them.
His dwelling was on Mount Golgotha
where he sowed wheat with his own
hands and made his own wine. So
that when Abraham met him, he
brought out to him some unleavened
bread still warm, and some wine ; a
figure of the Lord's Supper.

"Bnt why does S. Ephrem in hia
writings, say that Melchizedec was
Shem?" asks Gregory. And he answers:
" He had not two names neither is he a
different person. But Irinos (Irenaens ?)
gives the reason which is difficult
to understand. Noah blessed Shem,
but Shem had no son like himself to
bless. Abraham, however, was of the
family of Shem, and worthy of a
blessing. But Shem was not then
living, to bless him ; and Terah could
not bless. So Melchizedec took Sbem's

place and did what Shem wonid have
done, he blessed Abraham, and was
called Shem."

The passage in S. Ephrem (0pp.
Syr., vol. i, c. xiii, p. 60) runs thus :
" Melchizedec was Shem. He was
king by reason of his power as the head
of fourteen tribes. He was also priest,
having received the priesthood in due
order [or, course h'yuvolo} from Noah.
Not only was he living in the days of
Abraham, but he also saw Jacob and
Esau, and was consulted by Rebecca, as
to the children she was then bearing.

To this S. Chrysostom (Horn, xxxv
in Gen.) says that Melchizedec was
i(TWQ aiToxapoToi'jjTog oiJrw yap jjffaj/
TOTE 01 itpilg, perhaps self-ordained as
priests were in those days ; or by
reason of his old age ; or, may be, he
had practised the offering of sacrifices
like Abel, Noah, Abraham, etc. Mar-
cus Eremita (^Opusfi. x, de Melchizedec),
borrows from S. Athanasins, and agrees
with his account, of the three hundred-
and eighteen men who were with
Abraham, that they were a figure
of the three hundred and eighteen
patriarchs, who on Christ's side, iv ry

R. Jukhanan taught, that God took
Shem the son of Noah, and Itt^'^IDm
"imC^b lVb37 insb set him apart
for Priest of the Most High, to minister
before His Shekinah ; and then changed
his name to Melchizedec ; and that his
brother Japhet had learnt the law in
his school. And R. Bekhai (fiiwr. fol.
24) says of Melchizedec, king of Salem,

of the desert who believed Melchizedec
to have been the Son of God. The
matter was referred to S. Cyril of
Alex, who rebuked him for it.
Meanwhile the monk had a revelation
of all the patriarchs from Adam ; when
he saw that Melchizedec was indeed a
man. (For the sect of the Melchizedek-
ians, see S. Epiph. Eoeres. xxxv, vol. i ;

1 1 Then Noah went into the Cave of
Treasures and embraced the body of
Seth,of Enos,of Cainan, of Mahalaleel,
of Jared, of Methuselah and of Lamech.
Then he took the body of Adam, and
also the offerings : Shem carried the
gold. Ham the myrrh, and Japhet the
incense. (Eutych. Nazamal-j., p. 37.)

mountain, they lifted up their eyes and
wept, saying : " Farewell (lit. peace on

down. ( Eutych. A'^ozam al-j., p. 37.)

his wife, his sons and their wives, and
Noah carried the body of Adam and
laid it in the middle of the ark, and the

offerings (of gold, incense and myrrh)
upon it. Then he and his sons occupied
the eastern side of the ark, and his wife
and his sons' wires, the western side ;
lest they shonld come together. (Eutych.
Nazam alj., p. 38.)

1 4 And God said unto Noah : " Fasten
into the ark precious stones and pearls,
to lighten you up as in mid-day." (Tal-
mud Bab. SanhedA"., p. 176.)

And God said to Noah : " Go to
Phison, and choose from thence a
precious stone [Sim"*, Pers. juwar,
a * gem,' also a • pearl '] and fix it in
the ark, in order to give you light."
(Targ. Jonathan in Gen. vii.)

15 InBeresWtft,Eabba?i(adloc.)weare
told that Mount Gerizim was not covered
with the waters of the Flood ; because it
is but a small mountain ; and only the
highest mountains are said to have been
covered 1 S. Eustathius Antiochenus,
however, mentions in his Hexa'emeron
(col. 752, ed. M.) that petrified shells
and fishes were found on the top of
Mount Lebanon, in proof that the waters
of the flood had reached and covered the
highest summits of that chain.

16 On the seventeenth day of Ilul,
which is Thut, the seventh month
(according to the reckoning of the
Christians of Egypt), the ark rested
on the mountains of Ararat, that is
Djebel el-Djudi, near Mosul, in the
country of Diarabia, near a town called
Korda ; but it is now called the land of
Thamanim and Djezire Ben Omar.
(Eutych. Nazam al-j., p. 41.)

Quotations from the Assyrian accounts
of the Flood, as well as from the Pehlevi
Bundehesh [or, Creation] would be out
of place here. But they are well worth
the study of all who take interest in
these matters.

The mountain on which the ark
rested, is generally called Mount Ararat.
But " Ararat " is the name of one of
the provinces of Armenia, and is the



Hebrew term for Armenia. The Ar-
menians themselves, call that mountain
Mount Masis. (See for a learned
treatise on this subject, and for the
many names of the mountain, Injidjean,
Armen. Qeogr., vol. i, p. 54, sq.)

17 From the day this world was
destroyed by fire, to the day it was
destroyed by water, 100,000 years
elapsed. Then 8000 years later, a
voice came to me : " Build an ark."
He then got builders, and cut cedars in
Haran and in Lebanon, and was three
hundred years building the ark, three
hundred yards long, fifty broad, and
thirty in height ; wherein he gathered
animals of all kinds, male and female.
Then the fountains of heaven and earth
broke forth — and the ark after floating
on the waters eleven months, rested
on the mountains of Kardun. \_Kardu,
Targ.Onfe. Carducei M. in Ararat.] Then
Noah sent forth a raven, saying to it :
" Go and see if the flood has abated."
The raven went, found a carcase on
which it began to feed, and forgot
Noah's order. Then Noah sent forth
a dove, saying to it : "Go and see if
the flood is assuaged, and where the
raven is I sent forth before thee." The
dove went forth, found the raven feed-
ing on a carcase ; and then brought
back a branch of olive to Noah, who
then knew that the flood had abated.
Then Noah cursed the raven, but
blessed the dove. Thus was the race
of his son Shem and of his wife
Nnraito preserved ; and by them was the
earth peopled, etc. ( Cod. Nasar. iii, p. 72.)
Bar. Hebraeus Syr. (p. 7) says that
the ark rested at Apamsea, chief city of
Pisidia [of which there exists coins
with the ark and the dove. Bryant.
Ane. Myth., vol. iii, p. 47, sq.] ; but
Bar. Hebraeus Arab., says, with the
Targum, Cod. Nasar., and the Coran,
that it rested on Mount Kardu, or Jnda
[now called Dshudi] of Ararat or

Armenia. [This agrees with Scripture ;
and seems most likely, from the situa-
tion of those mountains as regards the
plain at Shinar — Sinjar— where the first
families settled after the Flood. The
Kufale calls Lnbar the mountain on
which the ark rested ; and the Sama-
ritan Pentateuch (Gen. viii, 4) says it
rested in Serandib, or Ceylon.]

18 The dove is a figure of the Holy
Ghost, says S. Ephrem (vol. i, p. 149.)
Her finding no resting place for her
foot, the first time, represents the
wickedness of men's manners among
which the Holy Ghost finds no resting
place. The second time the dove went
forth, figures the coming of Christ, and
the shedding forth of the Holy Ghost ;
while the olive branch is an emblem of
our reconciliation with God the Father.
The raven is of the devil. [See the
original for a very fair explanation of
the rainbow.]

19 Cedrenus alluding to the floods of
Ogyges in Attica and of Deucalion in
Thessaly says, that the Egyptians made
mention of the flood of Deucalion,
declaring that it had not reached them ;
and rightly too, says Cedrenus tottikos

flood was local ; and they could have no
knowledge of the universal deluge, for
their ancestor was not yet born. For
Ham, son of Noah, was father of
Mitsraim, whence are the Egyptians.
(Eist. Comp., p. 26.)

One shows still on Mount Djudi the
spot on which the ark rested, says
Masudi [but so do Armenians the same,
on Mount Masis, or Ararat]. Then
the earth was commanded to absorb the
waters; some portions of the earth were
slow at obeying God, other portions did
so at once. Those that obeyed, yield
fresh water when dug ; the disobedient,
were paoished by God, by remaining



salt. So that the seas are the remnant
of the waters in which the families [of
the earth] perished. (Masudi i, c. iii,
p. 76.)

And on the seventh month, Nisan,
the ark rested on the mountains of
Eadron ; the name of one mountain ia
Kardania, and of the other, Armenia ;
and there was the city of Armenia built,
in the land of the east— so says Targ.
Jonathan in Gen. viii.

So says also Abnlfeda Oeogr. Arab.,
p. 69, and El-kaswini, 'Ajaib, vol. i, p.
156, that remnants of the ark were
still to be seen on Mount Djudi,
whither people went on pilgrimage, and
whence they brought wood of the ark.

20 S. Ephrem (vol. i, p. 54, 150)
repeats this, which he rests on Gen. vii,
7, literally taken. But B. Jochanan
says that three disobeyed Noah's order
in this respect : the dog, the raven, and
Ham, all of which were punished. The
dog) by the leash ; the raven, by con-
tempt ; and Ham, in his skin. (Talm.
Bab. Sanhedrin, p. 216.)

21 And when they were come out of
the ark, they built themselves a city and
called it Thamanin, according to their
number, for (said they) " we are eight"

And the sons of Noah planted a vine,
and gave of the wine to their father,

When Noah was planting the vine,
Satan stood by him, and asked him
what he was doing. "Planting the
Tine," answered Noah. " What is the
good of it?" asked Satan. "The
fruit thereof is soft and sweet, whether
fresh or dry, and they make of it * wine,
that maketh glad the heart of man ' as
it is written." " Let me have a hand in
it, and let us do it together," said
Satan. And by and by, he brought
a Iamb under the vine and slew it
there ; likewise a lion, and also a swine.
Thereby meaning that a man who was
as meek as a Iamb, is made furious by
wine, or that he who drinks in modera-
tion (as it becometh him) is made
strong thereby, and he that drinks too
much revels in filth like a swine.

In the third year after oomisg oat of
the ark, says S. Ephrem, did Noah sow
vine, men kamshune daphkoshto, with
stones of raisins [or, dried grapes] which
he had stored up as provisions with
him in the ark. It would then take
the vine three or four years to bear
fruit ; BO that Noah drank of the wine
thereof, probably in the sixth or seventh
year after the waters of the Flood were
assuaged. {Ibid. vol. i, p. 56.)

According to the Kufale (c. vii, pp.
29, 30) Noah planted the vine first on
Mount Lnbar, on which the ark rested,
one of the mountains of Ararat. Then
Ham, after Noah's eurse on him, severed
himself from the rest and built a city,
called after his wife, Nehelata-mek.
Japhet, jealous of him, also built a cdty,
called after his wife, Adatenases ; and
Shem did the same, and built a city
which he called Sedukatelbab, also after
his wife. These three cities are all
near Mount Lubar, east, west and
south. [Noah's city, "Semanan" is
" Shamanin," " eight." It is mentioned
by Abulfeda Qeogr. Arab., p. 69.]

Josephus (^Ant. Jud., lib. i, c. iii, p. 5)
sa-js, *'that the place where the ark



rested, and whence Noah descended,
is called 'Airofiartjptov, and is shown
by the inhabitants." And Mich.
Tchamich in his History of Armenia,
vol. i, p. 56, says, that the ark having
rested on a mountain of Ararat [a
province of Armenia, so called],
that is on Mount Masis (^rb Mdaiov,
Strab. Qeogr., libi xii, c. ii), Noah
made ilr istehevan his descent near
it ; there he settled his sons, and
called the name of the city 'NakhAst-
chevan, the "first descent," or accord-
ing to others, Nakh-tohwam, "first
departure," or migration. (See also
Idjidjean, Qeogr. of Armenia, vol. i,

where one landed in a ship, the wood
of which remained there a long time.
Perhaps it is the one mentioned by
Moses. (See also Nicolas Dam. Uisto-

24 According to the Kufale (c. vii,
p. 31), in the twenty-eighth Jubilee,
Noah began to give his laws and
precepts to his children's children, with
right and judgment, and adjured them
to practise righteousness, to cover the
shame of their bodies, to bless their
Creator, to honour their father and
mother, to love their neighbour, and
to keep themselves from all adultery,
defilement, and violence. For it was
on account of this that God had
overwhelmed the earth with the Flood.
[These are the precepts which alone
were binding on the proselytes of the
Gate, or sojourners, among the Israelites.
Maimonides, Melakim, c. xiv, vol. ir,
p. 300, ed. fol. Amst.]

According to Avodath haqqodesh iii,
fol. 80 (quoted in Eisenmenger, vol. i,
p. 318), albeit the law was created
before the world, yet it had so far
been forgotten, and was likely to be
forgotten still so much more through
the wickedness and troubles that were
before the Flood, that God decreed to
give as few and as short command-
ments as possible ; so as to be easily
remembered. Noah had learnt these
commandments at school under Seth,
and handed them down to his sons.

25 When the death of Noah drew
near he called secretly his son Shem
and commanded him saying : " Take out
of the ark, unknown to any one, the



body of Adam ; and take with thee
bread and wine as provision by the
way; then take with thee Melchizedec
the son of Phaiek, and go and lay the
body of Adam where the angel of God
shall show you. Then command Mel-
chizedec to settle in that place ; not to
take him a wife; but to devote himself
to the service of God all the days of his
life; for God has chosen him to minister
before Him. He shall not build for
himself a house, neither shall he shed
the blood of either beast, bird, or other
living thing ; neither shall he bring
there any other offering to God than
bread and wine. His raiment shall be
skins of wild beasts [or, of a lion] ; he
shall not shave his hair, nor pare his
nails ; but he shall remain alone [or,
single] as priest of the Most High.
And the angel of God will go with
you two (lit. between you two) until ye
come to the place where ye shall bury
the body of Adam. And know thou
that that place is the middle of. the
earth. (Eutych, Nazam al-j., p. 45.)

26 The Kufale makes Noah divide
the earth by lot, among his sons. He
rejoiced over the lot fallen to Shem, in
fulfilment of his blessing on him, because
his possession which was to be for ever,
reached unto the River Gihon and the
Garden of Eden, taking in the most
holy places on earth. Mount Zion,
Mount Sinai, and the Garden of Eden,
where the Lord dwelt. {Ibid. c. viii,
pp. 36, 73.)

And the three sons of Noah, divided
the lot of their inheritance, among their
children, in presence of Noah their
father, who adjured them with a curse,
not to seek another inheritance than
that which had fallen by lot to them,
and they all said, laikun walaikwn, So
be it, and so be it I {Ibid. c. ix, p. 40.)

Soon after wicked spirits, or devils,
began to lead astray the children of
Noah, that were bom in the earth. He

then prayed to God, who commanded
ns, said the Angel of the Face, to bind
them for ever. But the Prince of the
Spirits, Mastema, stood before the Lord,
and prayed that He would leave him
some spirits of his race whereby to
deceive and harass the children of men.
So the Lord granted him one-tenth part
of his spirits ; and the rest he sent to
the place of judgment. Then we taught
Noah the use of remedies and the art of
healing; and he gave all his writings to
his son Shem, whom he loved most.
{Ktifale, c. X, pp. 41, 42.)

But whereas Ham, Cush and Mits-
raim, took possession of the land fallen
to them by lot, Canaan took with
violence possession of the land he
coveted, along the sea-shore. His
brothers remonstrated with him, and
told him he would be accursed for
having taken a lot that belonged to
Shem and had not fallen to him. But
he would not hearken to them; and
dwelt in the land from Hamath to
jEgypt. (Jhid. pp. 44, 45.)

Bar. Hebr. Syr., p. 9, attributes this
to all the sons of Ham.

27 Noah died nine hundred and fifty
years old. According to the reckoning
of the LXX, there are two thousand
two hundred and forty-two years from
the Creation to the Flood ; according to
the Jews, sixteen hundred and six; and
according to the Samaritans, thirteen
hundred and seven, which reckoning is
entirely wrong; in that it makes Noah
to have lived two hundred and twenty-
three years with Adam, whereof nothing
is said, either by God or by His pro-
phets. According to the reckoning of
Abinanns [Anianus?] of Alexandria,
however, from the creation of Adam
and the night of the Friday on which
the Flood began, there were two thou-
sand two hundred and twenty-six years,
one month, twenty-three days, and four
hours. (Abulpharaj, Byn. Arab., p. 14.)



28 It is commonly reported, says
Abulpharaj (Byn. Arab., p. 15), that
Noah just before his death gave Shem
a commandment saying : •' When I am
dead, bring the coffin of our father
Adam out of the ark, and take with
thee of thy children, Melchizedec, for he
is priest of the Most High God, and go
with him and the coffin to the place,
whither the angel of the Lord will lead
you." Those two did according ta
this commandment ; and the angel
brought them to the hill of Beth-el-
Maqdes [or, Muqaddas] and Melchizedec
laid the coffin on the hill, and settled
there; but Shem went back to hi»
people.

Melchieedec, however, did not go
back, but built there the city of
Jerusalem, which means the City of
Peace (whence himself is also called
Melek Salem, that is King of Peace);
and he spent the rest of his days in
devotion to the service of God ; he
never drew near a woman ; never shed
blood ; and his offering [qorban] was
of bread and wine only. But as Holy
Scripture, speaking of his exalted state,
mentions neither his birth nor his
death, the holy Apostle Paul says of
him that he had " neither beginning of
days, nor end of life." He was made
a type of Christ in David's prophecy.
" Thou art a priest for ever, after the
order of Melchizedec." On the very
same hill on which our father Adam
was buried, was Christ also crucified.

Melchizedec is called Lamech, Noah's
grandson, by Masudi, who adds that
those who believe the Scripture, think
Lamech is still living ; because God
said to Shem that he to whom He
should entrust the body of Adam,
would live for ever. And Shem,
after having laid Adam's body in the
centre of the earth, left it in charge
of Lamech. (Masudi i, ch. iii, pp.
80,81.)

29 And Fhalek begat Melchizedec
the priest. Then Shem did according
to what Noah had commanded him ;
he went into the aik by night, and
brought out the body of Adam ; no one
being aware of it. He then called his
brothers and said to them : " My father,
indeed, did command me before his
death, that I go forth until I arrive at
the sea, and see how the land lies and
the rivers and valleys thereof ; then
that I return to you. I will, therefore,
leave with you my wife and children;
and take care of them until my return."

Then Shem said to Phalek : " Give
me thy son Melchizedec, to be a help to
me on my journey." Then Shem took
with him the body of Adam and Mel-
chizedec, and departed. And the angel
of God met them, and did not depart
from between them until he had led
them to the middle of the earth, and
showed them the spot. When they
alighted the body of Adam upon it,
the earth opened itself ; Shem and
Melchizedec laid the body into the place
that had thus opened itself ; and it
closed itself again. And the name of
that is El-jaljala, that is, Cranium
(Golgotha). (Eutych. Nazam dlrj., p.
49.)

30 On this day — third of Epagumente
— we commemorate the death of Mel-
chizedec. This Melchizedec was the
son of Cainan, son of Shem. And when
he was fifteen years old, God com-
manded Noah to send Shem his son,
with the body of our father Adam, and
to lay it in the middle of the earth,
which is Cranin [Cranium, Golgotha] ;
and told him how the Saviour of the
world should come, be sacrificed there,
and redeem Adam with His blood.

Then Shem took Melchizedec from
bis father's house, and hid (him), and
brought him hither, whither the Angel
of the Lord brought them ; and Mel.
chizedec was consecrated priest, and



took twelve stones, and oflFered on them
a sacrifice of bread and wine, that came
down to him from heaven in his sight
(lit. he seeing), the mystery of a new
(covenant) law. A r gels also brought
him food ; and his raiment was of skins
with a leathern girdle. And he con-
tinued to minister before the body of
our father Adam. And when Abraham
returned from his victory over the
kings, Melchizedec offered him bread
and wine ; and Abraham also gave
him tithe of all. And he was called
priest and king of Salem. (Melchizedec,
in Dillmann's Chrestom. MtMojp., p. 16.)

31 Our Rabbis of blessed memory,
saysR. Abarbanel ( Com. in Pent., fol. 46)
and R. Abendana (in Leqet Shecha, fol.
6) are of opinion that Melchizedec is
Shem, the son of Noah, He is called,
Melchizedec, that is king of Jerusalem,
for Jerusalem is Zedec (righteousness),
because it makes righteous its inhabi-
tants. Beresh. Raiiah, fol. 47, and
Yedei Moshe, ad 1. add that Melchizedec
was bom already circumcised.

See S. Epiphanius {Adv. Boer,, vol. i,
p. 468, sq.) for his refutation of the sect
of Melchizedechians, who worshipped
Melchizedec instead of Christ. S.
Epiphanius says he has crushed them
wtTTTtp ftvoyaWiSiov \iQt^ iriTraiKOTtc,
" like a young shrewmouse struck with
a stone.'' (p. 476.)

32 Then Shem gave Melchizedec the
commandment he had received from
Noah, and said unto him : " Abide here,
and be priest of God : for God has
chosen thee to minister before Him.
And His angel shall come, down to thee
at all times." Then Shem went back
to his brothers ; and when Phalek asked
him what had become of the youth
Melchizedec, Shem answered, that he
was dead, and that he had buried him.
And they were much grieved at it.

daughter of Susan, daughter of Elam,
who bare him a son, Cainan. This
Cainan, taught letters by his father,
while looking for a place where to build
a city [Haran], found an inscription on
stone, the work of the Watchers, wherein
was recorded the course of heavenly
bodies, etc. ; but he hid the discovery
from Noah. (Kufale, c. viii, p. 34.)
Abulpharaj (Dyn. Syn., p. 7, 8 ; Arab.,
p. 15) remarks that Cainan, who lived
four hundred and thirty years, is not
reckoned in the Hebrew, Samaritan,
and Syriac texts. But he is reckoned
[in the LXX, and also] by S. Luke [c.
iii]. He is said to have invented astro-
logy ; and that his children raised a
statue to him, and worshipped him as a
god.

That inscription of the Watchers, or
children of Seth, and discovered by
Cainan, is alluded to by Josephus (^Ant.
Jud., lib. i, c. ii, p. 3) when he says that :
" the children of Seth, like their father,
excellent men given to virtue and to
the study of the heavenly bodies — and
not wishing that their discoveries should
perish altogether, with the world that
was to be destroyed by fire and water —
set up two pillars, one of brick and
the other of stone, on which they wrote
their astronomical observations. So
that if the pillar of brick was destroyed
by the waters, the one of stone should
remain. And it subsists to this day

years, God sent a strong wind, that
threw down the tower. (Bar. Hebr. Syr.,

37 S. Basil and Mar Ephrem say
that the original tongue was Syriac;
but S. James and John of Medin say
it was Hebrew, spoken by Eber, who
would not consent to the building of the
tower of Babel ; whose tongue, there-
fore, was not altered (Abulpharaj, Syr.,
p. 9 ; Arab., pp. 16, 18 ; Cedren. Hist.
Comp., p. 22), who thinks it is a proof
that Hebrew was the primitive tongue
spoken by Adam.

In those days the language and speech
of men were one and the same. Some
say it was the Syriac tongue; others say
it was the Hebrew; others again say,
that the tongue was Greek; and this
approves itself to me. For the Greek
language is wiser, clearer and broader
than either the Hebrew or the Syriac.

Then seventy-two men from among
the people gathered together and said :
" Let us build a city, and fortify it with
a wall ; and let us build a tower that
shall reach unto heaven ; that if a flood
betake us hereafter we may be saved
from it." They were three years making
bricks, every one of which was thirteen
yards long, ten yards broad, and five
yards thick, etc., and they were forty
years building the city. Then an
angel came down, and confounded
their languages, so that one could not
understand another ; and the name of
that city was called Babel, because the
languages were confused there, and
the people were dispersed. Of these
seventy-two men, twenty-five were of the

children of Shcm, thirty-two of those
of Ham, and fifteen of the children of
Japhet. Every one of these spake a
different tongue, that spread over the
face of the earth with their families.
(Eutych. Nazam al-j., pp. 53, 54.)

38 Bar Hebraeus relates a similar
legend, and says that Nimrnd's royal
crown was made of woyen material
[zaqlro — filagree?] {Dyn. Syr., p. 9), but
the Arabic copy adds that— some said
the crown had been let down from
heaven, (p. 18).

In the days of Ragu the queen of
Saba reigned many years. She built
the city of Saba ; and after her queens
reigned over that country until the
days of Solomon son of David.

In those days also reigned Karon, and
they say that he melted gold, and built
the city of Ukinin with bricks made
of gold. (Eutych. Nazam al-j.., p. 61.)

39 In the beginning of the thirty-
fifth Jubilee, Ragu took Ara, the
daughter of Kesed's son, who bare him
Serug, so called [aitt;] because in his
day men increased greatly in wicked-
ness fought one against another, took
captives, made idols and defiled the earth
with blood, etc. Ur, the son of Kesed,
built a city which he called Ara, where
he set up the worship of the host of
heaven and idols, and taught men to
worship them. Then did prince Mas-
tema exert himself to further all manner
of idolatry and wickedness among men.
Serug dwelt in Ur of the Chaldees,
where his wife Melka brought forth
Nahor, who in time took lyosaka daugh-
ter of Kheber the Chaldee, to wife, who
bare him Terah, Abraham's father.
(Kujale, c. xi, pp. 45, 46.)

Abulpharaj {Syn., p. 10 ; and Arab.,
p. 18, 19) relates that Serug invented
the coining of money ; and that the
art of spinning silk and of dyeing, was
introduced in his day, by Samirus, king
of Babylon.



In the days of Serug idolatry began.
Kal 6 'EWrivifffibe and Gentile worship
and superstitions. For not nntil then,
were there statues carved in wood, atone,
gold or silver ; before that man's imagi-
nation represented wickedness only in
colours, Serug begat Nahor, and Nahor
Terah, who was the first to make idols
of clay; and for his sin — in thus setting

Masudi (vol. i, p. 82, sq.) repeats the
same thing, partly borrowed from the
Coran, sur. c. vi, p. 75, sq. etc. ; c. xix,
p. 38, sq.

Arad the Canaanite, says Abul-
pharaj {Dyn. Syr., p. 10), affirms that
at this time the contiict of Job with
Satan took place. He fought him seven
times, and defeated him in every temp-
tation.

And the Coptic calendar says that on
the first day of the year. Job took a
warm bath, that cured him of his
leprosy.

40 In those days giants multiplied in
the earth. Then was 'Ad born, son of
Aram, son of Shem, son of Noah, in
whose time measures and weights were
invented. In his days there was also
a great and violent earthquake, such as
there had never been before; and this
was, because the worship of idols had
increased, and men sacrificed their sons
and their daughters to devils ; therefore
did God send upon them a tempestuous
wind, and a hurricane that broke down
all the idols, and demolished their
shrines; nntil the dust of them became
heaps and mounds that subsist unto this
day. (Eutych, Nazam al-j., p. 61.)

1 " Things," says R. Maimonides,
" went on from bad to worse, and
the knowledge of God continued only
among a few, such as Shem, Methuselah,
Enoch, Noah and Eber, until the
pillar of the world, our father Abraham,
was bom. No sooner was that valiant
one weaned, than he began to wonder,
or doubt, in his own mind, and small
as he was, he began to think day and
night, how it could be "H^iTl bzl^Sn

3^n3a lb n^W' wbi Tan am3

that this round world could go on so
continually without a Ruler; or who
makes it go round, since it could not
go round of itself. And so he went
on doubting, until he came to the
knowledge of the only true God, at
forty-eight years of age," etc. (Hala-
Iwt 'avoda kok., 0pp. vol. i, fol. p. 26.)

2 Astrologers [men of the stars]
observed the rising of the year in which
Abraham was born ; and they sent
word to Nimrud that a child should be
born who would set at naught their
dreams and overturn their worship.
Then Nimrud ordered all children to be
put to death. But Abraham was hidden
in a cave [shown as his birth-place
at Ur, or Urfah]. (Masudi i, c. iii,
p. 83.)

3 " It is well known," says R. M.
Maimonides, " that our father Abraham,
on whom be peace, was brought up in
the faith of the SabsDans, andCnVTI



D^^DIDn p"l nibs ^Sa? in their
teaching [or, knowledge, doctrine] that
there was no other God than the stars.
When Abraham objected to this, and
opposed their worship, we read in
n">l033n HTOyn the Book of the
Agriculture of the Nabathoeans, that
the king of the place where Abraham
lived, shut him up in prison ; but
fearing lest his people should be turned
from their faith, he confiscated all his
property and banished him n!Jpb
n~lTDn to the extreme east. [More
Nevukim, iii, c. 29.)

In those days prince Mastema [Satan]
sent ravens in great numbers, that
devoured the seed sown, and the crops
that were raised ; so that men gathered
in the fruits of the earth wiih great
difficulty. And about that time Terah
took Edna, daughter of Abram, to
wife, who bare him a son whom he
called Abram, after his wife's father.
This Abram, when fourteen years old,
began to pray his Creator to save
him from the wickedness around him,
and to give him an inheritance with
the righteous. Then came sowing time ;
and Abram went with others to watch
the fields sown with seed. A flight of
ravens then came down, and when
about to alight, Abram ran, and bade
them go back to whence they came.
He did so seven times that day. And
all people came to entreat him to go

with them when they sowed their seed,
to keep off the ravens. He then
contrived a plough whereby the seed
fell into the earth and got covered at
once ; so that they no longer were
afraid of the ravens. And Abram's
name waxed great in Chaldsea. (_Kufale,
c. xi, pp. 47, 48.)

This legend is variously told by
eastern writers. Bar. Hebrseus ( Chron.
Syr. Arab., p. 11) simply says Abram
drove away ravens, when fourteen years
old ; but (in his Hist. Dyn. Arab., p. 19,
20) he add8,"God heard Abram's prayers
when fifteen years old, about magpies
that laid waste the land of Chaldsea.
S. Ephrem (vol. i, p. 156) says, "that
Abram when a child, having been sent
by Terah to drive away ravens [wrongly
rendered ' locusts ' by the translator]
sent to destroy the crops, as a punish-
ment for the idolatry of the land,
Abram — unable to drive them away — by
a sudden impulse called upon God to
order them off, who answered : ' Here
am I,' and ordered the ravens away
from Terah's field." [For the story of
Abraham being cast into a burning
furnace by the inhabitants of Ur, see
Cor an, sur. xxi ; and Kufale, c. xii.]

Targ. Jonathan, in Gen. xii, says :
** Abram was cast into the fiery furnace
by order of Nimrud ; because he would
not worship the idol Nimrud had set
iip," etc.

4 Terah was a worshipper of idols.
But Abraham turned him from them,
and talked to him, and taught him
Hebrew, his native tongue [lit. of his
xsreation] ; and showed him how God
had commanded him to go out of
Haran unto the land of Canaan, to look
M it, and come back. To which Terah
said : " Go in peace, God of the worlds
prosper thy way, and the Lord kepp
thee safe from all evil, and show thee
kindness and mercy, and give thee
/avour in the ejes of all those who see



thee ; that no man do thee hann. Go
in peace. And if thou seest the land
is pleasant in thine eyes, to dwell there,
then come and take me to be with thee.
Take with thee Lot, the son of Haran
thy brother, to be a son unto thee. But
leave thy brother Nahor with me, until
thy return in peace ; when all of ns
shall go together with thee." {Kufale,
c. xii, pp. 51, 52.)

5 " In those days appeared Melchize-
dec, irapBtvoQ itptvg, an unmarried
priest, son of king Sidus, son of Egyptus,
who founded the town of Sidon. He is
said to be without father and mother, and
without kindred, 5«o to fin «? 'lovSaiKijc

he shut up Sarah in a box. But at the
custom-house the officers asked him to
pay duty on his luggage. " What is
it, wares?" asked they. "I will pay
duty on them," answered Abraham.
"Is it gold?" "Also on gold," said
he. " Is it pearls, then ? " "I will
pay duty also on pearls," answered
Abraham. " This will never do," said
the officers, " Open thy trunk !" As
Abraham opened it the whole land of
Egypt was nVTQ Hp^H^n lighted
up with Sarah's brilliancy. (Bereshith

7 About the rising of the moon [new
moon] of the fourth month, " We," says
the Angel of the Face, " appeared unto
Abraham, by the oak of Mamrim, and
we conversed with him, and gave him
to understand that a son would be given
him of Sarah his wife. But Sarah
laughed, when she heard us say these
words to Abraham ; and we rebuked
her ; but she was afraid and lied about
having laughed at these [our] words."
(Zu/ole, c. xvi, pp. 61, 62.)

About this time as our father Abra-
ham sat at the door of his tent, three
ministering angels were sent to him, on
three errands : ( 1 ) to tell him of the
birth of his son ; (2) to deliver Lot ;
(3) to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah ;
for it cannot be that a ministering angel
be sent with in «b"'S3 ]» "l\n"^b more
than one message at a time. (Targ.
Jonathan and Hieros, in Gen. xvii. )

8 Isaac was thirty-seven years old,
bom when Sarah was ninety years of
age. Hearing of God's order to Abra-
ham to sacrifice Isaac, she sickened,
from grief, and died of that sickness
that same year, aged one hundred and
twenty-seven. (Eutych. Nazam al j.,
p. 77.)

For the conversation that took place
between Abraham and Isaac on this
occasion, see S. Eustatbius Antioch. in
Eexa'emeron, col. 764, ed. M.

9 And it happened about this time
that words were spoken in heaven about
Abraham, how faithful he was in all
that the Lord told him, and how true
in all temptations. Then prince Mas-
tema came forward and said to God :
" Behold, Abraham loves his son Isaac
best of all, tell him to offer him in
sacrifice upon an altar ; then shalt thou
see if he will do it, and be true and
faithful in all that Thou commandest
him." Then follows the Scripture
account, as far as "Abraham took a
knife," etc., when I» the Angel of the



Face, stood before God and Prince
Mastema. And God said to me : " Go
and tell him not to lay his hand on the
child, and not to hurt him ; for I know
now that he fears God," etc. Then
Mastema felt ashamed of himself.
{Kufale, c. xvii, xviii, pp. 67, 68, 69.)

Cedrenus {Hist. Cornp., p. 53) repeats
this legend, but calls Mastema, MaaTiipar
borrowed probably from the Greek
original of the Ethiopic Kufale.

" It is well known," says R. M. Mai-
monides, " that the worshippers of idols
always chose high places and mountains
whereon to build their temples. There-
fore did Abraham choose Mount Moriah,

on which "H "nn'-n nw DDns

he proclaimed the unity of God, as
being one of the highest hills in that
neighbourhood. But he consecrated
the w'l^stern side of it for the sanctuary ;
so as tp turn his back on the idolaters
who always turn to the east, in wor-
shipping the morning sun." {More
Nevukim, sect, iii, ch. 45.)

10 After Abraham had done bless-
ing all his children and grandchildren,
he and Jacob, lay together on the same
bed. Then Abraham in his anxiety [or
care] embraced Jacob seven times, and
rejoiced over him, and added yet more
to all the blessings he had given him.
He then lay two of Jacob's fingers on
his own eyes ; he blessed the God of
gods, covered his face, stretched his
legs, and died. And when Jacob
awoke from sleep, he knew not that
Abraham was dead, but called to him :
" Father, father !" But when he felt
him cold, he ran and told Kebekah,
his mother, who told Isaac ; and they
both came with a light, and found
Abraham laid out. Then they buried
him, in the double-cave [Machpelah],
and mourned over him forty days.
{Kufale, c. xxii, xxiii, pp. 82, 83.)

Abraham lived upwards of three
Jubilees and a half, because he was



250

[book



righteous ; for after the Flood man's
life was cat short. And from Abra-
ham forth, it will be said that, whereas
the patriarchs lived eighteen or nineteen
Jubilees, and had peace, now men only
live seventy or eighty years and all is
trouble, because of the wickedness of
the world, that will grow worse and
worse. Men will be covetous, eager
for wealth, in order to get themselves
a name thereby ; and defile the Most
Holy with their evil deeds. They shall
do evil — the young with the old, the old
with the young ; the poor with the rich,
and rich with the poor ; the mean with
the judge, by reason of the law and
judgment ; because- they shall have
forgotten the commandments of God
and right, feasts, moons, Sabbaths,
jubilees, and all manner of judgment
{Kujale, c. xxiii, pp. 84, 85.)

11 Eutychus says Hiram was the
first to clothe himself in purple, that
was discovered thus : There was a
shepherd with his dog one day tending
his sheep on the sea-shore. The dog
found a purple shell creeping on the
shore and having eaten it, the shepherd
wiped with some wool the dog's mouth
that was full of purple colour. With
the wool thus dyed the shepherd made
himself a fillet or crown which he
placed on his head. Every one who
saw him walking in the sun thus
arrayed, thought that a ray of light
shone forth from his head. Hiram
heard of it, sent for the shepherd,
wondered at the beauty of the colour,
and ordered his dyers of stuffs to dye
a cloak for him of the same colour.
(Nazam al-j., pp. 173, 174.)

12 As with Abraham, so with Solo-
mon there exists a whole literature
about his wisdom and marvellons deeds,
celebrated from his throne (Takht-i-
Suleyman) on the Suleyman range of
the Hindoo Koosh, to his dialogue with
Saturn in the far north. The Suleyman



Nameh, of which extracts arc given by
Baron Hammer-Purgstall, in Rosen-ol,
vol. i, is said to consist of sixty volumes ;
but the stories of him in the Targum
of Jerusalem on Esther, and in the
Talmud (Gittin 68 ; see Fiirst Perlen-
schwre, p. 121) are a thousand years
older ; so also the accounts of the Wise
King found in Eusebius (Prcep. Ev.),
Josephus, the Goran, etc. For his
psalms, see Fabric. Cod. Apoc. V- T.,
vol. i, and Woide's Sahidic New T.
pref. for the same in Sahidic.

" In the opinion of many Syrian
authors," says Abr. Echellensis (Catal.
Lib. Hebed Jesu, p. 238, sq.), " Solomon
not only translated into Syriac the greater
part of the Old Testament — the Pen-
tateuch, Joshua, Judges, Ruth, Samnel,
David, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of
Songs, and Job — at Hiram's especial
request, but he also invented the
characters, according to Jesudad, who
says that, ' Whereas Moses invented the
Hebrew letters, Solomon invented all
others, which he gave to the peoples by
which he was honoured ; but he first
of all invented the Syriac letters which
he gave to Hiram, king of Tyre.' "

13 After the death of Hezekiali,
Manasseh forgot his father's command-
ments ; and Samael took possession of
Manasseh, and clung to him. Then
Manasseh forsook God, served Satan,
his angels and his powers, and turned
his heart to the worship of Serial
[Belial]. Then all manner of wicked-
ness, magic and sorcery increased in
Jerusalem ; Isaiah seeing this removed
from Jerusalem, went and dwelt at
Bethlehem. But as Bethlehem was
equally corrupt, he and Michaiah, Joel,
and Habakkuk and his son Josheb, and
others who believed that the righteous
would go up to heaven — resided on
a hill, clothed in skins and living on
roots and herbs of the mountains.

Then Isaiah had a vision of the

coming of the Beloved, for which
Berial was angry with him, and took
possession of the heart of Manasseh
who sawed Isaiah with a saw to cat
wood.

While he was being thus cut asunder,
Belkira, Bankembeki and Berial stood
opposite, deriding him. Manasseh also
and Melkira and bis false prophets,
stood by looking on. Bat Isaiah while
being thus sawn asunder neither cried
nor wept ; but his month conversed
with the Holy Ghost. '

Thus did Manasseh according to the
will of Satan. {Ascension of Isaiah,
c. 2-5.)

14 The Ethiopic translator omitted
the story told in the Arabic original —
that, when Isaiah was about to be sawn
asnnder, he wanted water to drink and
prayed God to give him some, as He
had done to Moses, when smiting the
rock. Then God told him to stamp
the rock under him with his foot,
whence a spring of water at once burst
forth, that has continued unto this day.

16 As for Jeremiah the prophet, they
found him hidden and covered with
mud in a land of waters (marsh).
(Enseb. De Stella, p. 2, ed. W.Wright.)
Jeremiah having fled into Egypt, was
there stoned to death, and buried. But
Alexander when he came into Egypt,
brought the body of Jeremiah to
Alexandria, and buried it there.
(Eutych. Nazam al-j., p. 252.)

Christ ... 30 yrs.

17 In the year 309 of Alexander, the
Lord Christ was bom of the Virgin
Mary, when Cyrenius was sent by
Csesar to Jerusalem. Joseph went up
with Mary to Bethlehem to inscribe
their names. Mary brought forth. And
Magi in their joumeyings came and
offered unto Christ gold, incense and
myrrh, who on their first interview with
Herod, when asked by him their errand,
said to him : " There was a great man
among us who prophesied in a book he
wrote, that in Palestine should be bom
a child of heavenly race, whom the
greater part of the world would serve.
And the sign thereof unto you will be
a star that will guide you to the place
where the child is ; and when ye see
it ye shall offer to Him gold, incense
and myrrh. We saw the star and
we are come to worship Him," etc.
(Abulpharaj, Byn, Arab., pp. 109,
110.)

This supposed prophecy is again men-
tioned by Abulpharaj {id., p. 83). When
speaking of Cyrus he says : " In those
days came Zeradasht, chief of the
Magian sect, by birth of Adjerbijan, or,
as some say, of Assyria. It is reported
that he was one of the prophet Elijah's
disciples [as Confucius was of Daniel
(?)], and he informed the Persians of
the sign of the birth of Christ, and that
they should bring Him gifts. And he told
them that in after-time a virgin should
be with child without having known
man ; and that about the time of her
bringing forth a star brilliant by day
would appear, in the midst of which
would be seen the figure of a young
virgin. Yon, then, my children, will be
favoured before all other people with
the Light of that Star ; and when ye
see it, go whither it leads you ; worship
the child, and offer Him gold, incense
and myrrh."

It is needless to say that no such pro-
phecy of Zeradasht or Zoroaster does

exist. Neither does Abalpharaj allude
to it in his Sjriac work, which in many
respects differs from the same in Arabic ;
done by him shortly before his death for
his Arab friends at Mabug, some con-
siderable time after his first work in
Syriac.

The number of Magi — or, as some
say, of kings with their armies — is
variously stated. Eutychus {Nazam
al-j., p. 310) says that only three Magi
came, who told Herod the star had
appeared to them two years before
their arrival at Jerusalem. t6v darkpa,
iiriTiWovTa ydti irph Svo fiaXiara
Twv iviavTuv, Kai oifxi /xfra Svo rrjc
ytvvijtTtug iTt], says Nicephorus Callix-
tus (Eccles. Hist., lib. i., c. 13), who with
Origen, S. Basil, S. Chrysostom, etc.,
refers the star to Balaam's prophecy.
Nay, Eusebius probably wrote the small
treatise on the star attributed to him,
which exists only in Syriac, in order to
show that Balaam's prophecy travelled
eastward from Moab, and was handed
down by Persian kings until the days
of Augustus Caesar ; when the star did
actually appear. Then were the king
and the pe5ple greatly troubled at the
light of the star that outshone all other
celestial bodies by day as well as by
night. The king therefore prepared
offerings of myrrh and of incense,
which he sent by Magi, worshippers of
fire. But as the king did not know
where Christ was bom, he commanded
those who can-ied the gifts, saying :
" Follow the leading of the star as you
go, by day and by night keep to the
light of the star; for the brilliancy
thereof will guide you even when the
sun is risen." Then they went to
Bethlehem, and returned and told the
king what they had seen and heard, etc.
(Pp. 16, 17, fol. 12 of MS., ed. W.
Wright.)

mites habuissent ? Hi vero protulerunt

ipsis tradiderat, etc. {Evangel. Infantice,
c. vii, viii, ed. Fabr.)

M. Tchamitch, in his Badmuthyiin
Hayots (" History of Armenia "), vol. i,
p. 277, relates also that " the wonderful
birth of Christ was made known by
means of a star, erits tnakuts thahavo-
rats, to three Magi-kings, who came to
Judaea to find Him and to worship
Him." (See note from the " History of
Georgia," at Book I, ch. xx.)

" What sign then did you see," asked
Herod of the wise men, " to tell you a
king was bom." They said unto him :
" We saw a very large star, shining
among the celestial bodies, and out-
shining them all, and we thus knew
that a great king was bora in Israel,
and we came to worship Him." {Proto-ev.
Jacobi, c. xxi.)

Fabricius thus quotes from his own
edition of Chalcidius, p. 21 9, ad Timcewm
" Est quoque alia sanctior et venerabilior
historia, quae perhibet ortu stellae cujns-
dam non morbos mortesque denunciatas,

repertaqne ilia majestate pnerili, vene-
ratos esse," etc, (Cod. Ap. N.T., vol. ii,
p. 116.)

Solomon, Bp. of Bolsra (or Bassora),
says in his Deburitho (or Bee, as quoted
by Assem. Bihl. Or., vol. iii, p. 316),
that the Magi were twelve Persian
princes, whose names he gives at length.
These occur also, with few changes, in
other MSS., both Syriac and Arabic.
Bar. Hebraeus, or Abulpharaj , in his Ozwr
ros6, or "Storehouse of secrets," says
that the Magi were only three princes
who came with a thousand men (sent by
Mahir-Shapur, king of Persia, to wor-
ship Christ). But James, the Bishop,
says they were twelve princes, who
having left seven thousand of their men



at the Euphrates, came to Jerusalem
with only one thousand. The Bp. of
Botsra, however, does not quote the tra-
dition received by other historians, that
the presents brought by the Magi to
Christ were those which Adam had laid
up in the Cave of Treasures ; which he
made over to his son Seth, and which
had been handed down unto the coming
of Christ.

Of those twelve princes, four, namely,
Zarvandad, Hormisdas, Guznasaph, and
Arsaces brought gold ; four, Zarvandad
son of Varzud, Orthoes, Artaxerxes,
and Estnnabudanes brought myrrh ;
and four, Maruch, Assuerus, Sardalach
and Merodach brought incense ; accord-
ing to the Bp. of Botsra.
