<P>"We can see on our planet 17 very strange features which can now be systematically explained as a result of a cataclysmic global flood who's water erupted from subterranean chambers with an energy release exceeding the explosion of ten billion hydrogen bombs.
<P>"This expiation shows us just how rapidly major mountains formed.  It explains the coal and oil deposits, the rapid continental drift, why on the ocean floor there are huge trenches and hundreds of canyons and volcanos.  It explains the formation of the layers strata and most of the fossils; of the frozen mammoths, the so-called ice ages and major land canyons, especially the grand canyon.

<P>"The pre-flood earth probably had only one very large super-continent covered with lush vegetation.  There were seas and major rivers.  The mountains were smaller than today's, but perhaps 9000 feet high.

<P>"According to the hydro plate theory, the pre-flood earth had a lot of subterranean water; about half of what is now in our oceans.  This water was contained in interconnected chambers forming a thin spherical shell about half a mile thick perhaps 10 miles below the earth's surface.
<P><A Href="08.jpg"><IMG Src="tn_08_jpg.jpg" Border="0" alt="08.jpg" LowSrc="lr_08_jpg.gif" Width="96" Height="72"></A>
<P>"Increasing pressure in the subterranean water stretch the crust, just as the balloon stretches when the pressure inside increases.
<P><A Href="09.jpg"><IMG Src="tn_09_jpg.jpg" Border="0" alt="09.jpg" LowSrc="lr_09_jpg.gif" Width="96" Height="72"></A>
   <A Href="10.jpg"><IMG Src="tn_10_jpg.jpg" Border="0" alt="10.jpg" LowSrc="lr_10_jpg.gif" Width="96" Height="72"></A>
<P>"Failure in the crust began with a microscopic crack which grew in both directions at about 3 miles per second.  The crack, following the path of least resistance, encircled the globe in about two hours.
<P><A Href="11.jpg"><IMG Src="tn_11_jpg.jpg" Border="0" alt="11.jpg" LowSrc="lr_11_jpg.gif" Width="96" Height="72"></A>
<A Href="12.jpg"><IMG Src="tn_12_jpg.jpg" Border="0" alt="12.jpg" LowSrc="lr_12_jpg.gif" Width="96" Height="72"></A>
<P>"As the crack raced around the earth, the overlaying rock crust opened up like a rip in a tightly stretched cloth.  The subterranean water was under extreme pressure because the weight of the 10 miles of rock pressing down on it.
<P><A Href="13.jpg"><IMG Src="tn_13_jpg.jpg" Border="0" alt="13.jpg" LowSrc="lr_13_jpg.gif" Width="96" Height="72"></A>
   <A Href="14.jpg"><IMG Src="tn_14_jpg.jpg" Border="0" alt="14.jpg" LowSrc="lr_14_jpg.gif" Width="96" Height="72"></A>
   <A Href="15.jpg"><IMG Src="tn_15_jpg.jpg" Border="0" alt="15.jpg" LowSrc="lr_15_jpg.gif" Width="96" Height="72"></A>
<P>"So the water exploded violently out of the rupture.  All along this globe encircling rupture fountains of water jetted supersonically almost 20 miles into the atmosphere.  The spray from this enormous fountain produced torrential rains such as the earth has ever experienced, before or after.
<P>"The bible states that all the fountains of the great deep burst open on one day.  And it describes these events, about 5000 years ago, which we can now tie together scientifically.
<P>"Some of the water, jetting high above the cold stratosphere, froze into super-cooled ice crystals and produced some massive ice dumps; burring, suffocating and instantly freezing many animals, including the frozen mammoths of Siberia and Alaska.

<P><A Href="18.jpg"><IMG Src="tn_18_jpg.jpg" Border="0" alt="18.jpg" LowSrc="lr_18_jpg.gif" Width="96" Height="72"></A>
<P>"The high pressure fountains eroded the rock on both sides of the crack producing huge volumes of sediments that settled out of this muddy water all over the earth.  These sediments trapped and buried plants and animals forming the fossil record.

	<A Href="22.jpg"><IMG Src="tn_22_jpg.jpg" Border="0" alt="22.jpg" LowSrc="lr_22_jpg.gif" Width="96" Height="72"></A>
<P>"This erosion widened the rupture.  Eventually the width was so great that the compressed rock, beneath the subterranean chamber, sprung upward; giving birth to the mid-oceanic ridge that raps the earth like the seam of a baseball.
<P><A Href="23.jpg"><IMG Src="tn_23_jpg.jpg" Border="0" alt="23.jpg" LowSrc="lr_23_jpg.gif" Width="96" Height="72"></A>
	<A Href="24.jpg"><IMG Src="tn_24_jpg.jpg" Border="0" alt="24.jpg" LowSrc="lr_24_jpg.gif" Width="96" Height="72"></A>
	<A Href="25.jpg"><IMG Src="tn_25_jpg.jpg" Border="0" alt="25.jpg" LowSrc="lr_25_jpg.gif" Width="96" Height="72"></A>
<P>"The continental plates, the hydro plates, still with lubricating water beneath them, slid downhill away from the rising mid-Atlantic  ridge.
<P><A Href="26.jpg"><IMG Src="tn_26_jpg.jpg" Border="0" alt="26.jpg" LowSrc="lr_26_jpg.gif" Width="96" Height="72"></A>
	<A Href="27.jpg"><IMG Src="tn_27_jpg.jpg" Border="0" alt="27.jpg" LowSrc="lr_27_jpg.gif" Width="96" Height="72"></A>
	<A Href="28.jpg"><IMG Src="tn_28_jpg.jpg" Border="0" alt="28.jpg" LowSrc="lr_28_jpg.gif" Width="96" Height="72"></A>

<P>"After the massive, slowly accelerating continental plates reached speeds of about 45 miles per hour, they ran into resistance, compressed and buckled.  The portions of the hydro plate that bucked down formed ocean trenches. Those that buckled upward formed mountains. This is why the major mountain chains are parallel to the oceanic ridges from which they slid.
<P><A Href="31.jpg"><IMG Src="tn_31_jpg.jpg" Border="0" alt="31.jpg" LowSrc="lr_31_jpg.gif" Width="96" Height="72"></A>
<P>"The hydro plates, in sliding away from the oceanic ridges, opened up very deep ocean basins  into which the flood waters retreated.  On the continents each bowl shaped depression, or basin, was naturally left brim full of water; producing many post-flood lakes."
